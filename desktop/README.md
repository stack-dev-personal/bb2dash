# bb2dash desktop shell

A thin Electron window around the deployed bb2dash web app, plus the two jobs a
browser tab cannot do: raise a Windows toast when something happens, and open a
terminal that runs a Blackboard sync.

The web app is still the product. Nothing under `web/` changes for this to work,
and nothing in here renders any of the UI — it loads `appUrl` and gets out of the
way.

Windows 11 only. Unpacked build, no installer, no code signing, no auto-update
(Phase 12 contract, C-10). New builds come from the logon builder in
[`launch/`](launch/README.md), and the app swaps to one only when Stack presses
**Update now** (see *Updates* below).

## Prerequisites

| | version used to build and test this |
|---|---|
| Node | v24.13.0 |
| npm | 11.6.2 |
| Electron | **44.4.1**, pinned exactly in `package.json` |

Electron is pinned rather than ranged: a shell whose only job is to be stable
should not pick up a new Chromium on an `npm install`.

```powershell
cd desktop
npm ci          # not `npm install` — the lockfile is the build
```

## Configuration

`config.json` lives in the app's `userData` folder:

```
%APPDATA%\bb2dash\config.json
```

Every key except `supabaseAnonKey` has a default. A file that does not validate
stops the app with a dialog naming the offending field; the app never starts on a
half-understood config, because a wrong `appUrl` or `repoDir` points the window or
the terminal somewhere unintended.

```json
{
  "appUrl": "https://web-xi-ten-uy9xk6c6p0.vercel.app",
  "supabaseUrl": "https://goultdzqcavefcgnifdy.supabase.co",
  "supabaseAnonKey": "paste the project legacy anon JWT here",
  "repoDir": "C:\\Users\\stack\\projects\\bb2dash",
  "pollIntervalMinutes": 15,
  "dueReminderTime": "18:00"
}
```

| key | default | meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `appUrl` | the Vercel deployment above | the deployed web app; one of the only two origins the window may navigate to |
| `supabaseUrl` | the project URL above | PostgREST and Storage; the second allowed origin |
| `supabaseAnonKey` | **required** | the project's legacy anon JWT — the same value `web/` already ships in its browser bundle |
| `repoDir` | `<profile>\projects\bb2dash`, derived from the signed-in user's home folder (`C:\Users\stack\projects\bb2dash` on stack-laptop) | working directory for the Sync terminal: the `main` checkout, where `/bb-sync` runs |
| `pollIntervalMinutes` | `15` | how often the notification poller ticks while the app runs |
| `dueReminderTime` | `18:00` | New York wall-clock time the once-a-day "due tomorrow" check runs |
| `syncDryRun` | `false` | when true the Sync terminal prints the command instead of running it |
| `syncLauncher` | `terminal` | `terminal`: the Sync button opens Windows Terminal on `/bb-sync`. `queue-only`: the button only queues and the container's runner takes the request; no terminal opens, and when the runner raises "Blackboard login needed" the app opens `http://127.0.0.1:6080/vnc.html` once in the default browser, already unlocked (brief 100, task 18) |
| `novncPasswordFile` | `<profile>\.bb2dash-secrets\novnc_password` | the file the login page's noVNC password is read from under `queue-only`; a BOM, CR and LF are stripped, and the password goes only into the URL handed to the browser, never into the log. A missing or unreadable file opens the page without it |

**Secrets.** The anon key is the only credential in this package, and it is not a
secret: it is public in the web bundle already, and row-level security is the
boundary. A `service_role` or `sb_secret` key must never appear here —
`test/unit/audit.test.ts` greps `src/` and `test/` for both on every run. The
key belongs in `config.json` on the machine, never in the repository.

**Environment overrides.** Every key can be overridden by an environment
variable (`BB2DASH_APP_URL`, `BB2DASH_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY`, `BB2DASH_REPO_DIR`,
`BB2DASH_POLL_INTERVAL_MINUTES`, `BB2DASH_DUE_REMINDER_TIME`,
`BB2DASH_SYNC_DRY_RUN`, `BB2DASH_SUPABASE_URL`, `BB2DASH_SYNC_LAUNCHER`,
`BB2DASH_NOVNC_PASSWORD_FILE`). The e2e suite uses them to point
the shell at a local fixture page so no test ever reaches `*.supabase.co`.

## Build, test, pack

```powershell
cd desktop

npm run build      # tsc -> dist/{core,main,preload}
npm run typecheck  # tsc --noEmit over src + test + playwright.config.ts
npm test           # vitest over test/unit, with coverage thresholds enforced
npm run test:e2e   # builds, then Playwright-for-Electron over test/e2e
npm start          # builds, then runs the shell from source
npm run pack       # builds, then electron-builder --dir
```

`npm run pack` produces:

```
desktop\dist\win-unpacked\bb2dash.exe
```

That folder is the whole app. It can be copied anywhere; the config and all
state live in `%APPDATA%\bb2dash`, not next to the executable.

`npm run icons` regenerates `build/icon.ico` and `build/tray-16.png` from
`build/icon.png`. The outputs are committed, so a normal build never runs it.

## Shortcuts

```powershell
cd desktop
.\scripts\make-shortcut.ps1 -WhatIf    # see what it would write
.\scripts\make-shortcut.ps1            # write them
```

It writes two shortcuts to the packed executable:

* `Desktop\bb2dash.lnk` — the double-click.
* `Start Menu\Programs\bb2dash.lnk` — the same target, **plus the shell property
  `System.AppUserModel.ID = su.stack.bb2dash`**.

That property is not decoration. Electron's notification documentation is
explicit: *"for notifications on Windows, your Electron app needs to have a Start
Menu shortcut with an AppUserModelID"*. An installer would write it; this build
has no installer. Without a Start Menu shortcut carrying an ID that matches the
`app.setAppUserModelId('su.stack.bb2dash')` call in the main process, Windows
drops every toast silently — no error, no notification, nothing in the log.
If toasts never arrive, this shortcut is the first thing to check.

No `ToastActivatorCLSID` is set: that is only needed for toast *action buttons*,
and this MVP's toasts are click-only.

Both shortcuts point at wherever the executable was when the script ran. Re-run
it after moving or re-packing the build.

## First launch: SmartScreen

The executable is unsigned on purpose (no code signing in this phase), so
Windows may show:

> **Windows protected your PC**
> Microsoft Defender SmartScreen prevented an unrecognised app from starting.

Click **More info**, then **Run anyway**. Windows remembers the decision for
that file; it comes back if the executable is rebuilt or moved.

SmartScreen's reputation check is triggered by the "mark of the web" that
Windows attaches to downloaded files. A build produced locally by
`npm run pack` usually carries no such mark and starts without any prompt; the
warning is expected if the `win-unpacked` folder is ever zipped, copied off the
machine and brought back.

## Living with it

* **Closing the window closes it for real** (2026-09-30). The web app's renderer
  process goes away; the main process, the tray and the poller keep running, so
  toasts still arrive. The tray menu is **Open bb2dash / Check now / Quit**;
  left-clicking the tray icon or choosing *Open* builds a fresh window, and
  clicking a toast builds one straight at the toast's screen. **Quit** is the
  only thing that ends the process.
  Measured on the packed build (signed-out page, so the renderer is on the small
  side), two open/close cycles each:
  * with GPU acceleration on (first cut): open 4 processes, 434-660 MB working
    set; closed 3 processes, 295-313 MB (main ~110, GPU ~130, utility ~57).
  * with GPU acceleration **off** (Stack, 2026-09-30; `app.disableHardwareAcceleration()`
    in `src/main/index.ts`): open 4 processes, 355-364 MB working set / ~118 MB
    private; closed 3 processes, 258-259 MB / ~81 MB private (main ~103, GPU
    ~100, utility ~56). Chromium still runs a GPU process for software
    compositing, but its private memory drops sharply.
* **The session stays fresh with the window closed.** When the web session has
  expired and no window is open, the shell loads the app once in a hidden page
  for 20 seconds (at most every 10 minutes) so the web app's own proxy rewrites
  the cookie, then destroys the page. Main still never calls the auth API.
* **One instance.** Launching a second time shows and focuses the window that is
  already open, or builds one if it was closed; there is never a second taskbar
  button.
* **Signing in** happens on the web app's own `/login` page inside the window.
  The session cookie lives in the window's persistent partition, so it survives
  a restart. The shell reads that cookie to make its own database reads and
  never refreshes it — token rotation stays the web app's job.
* **Logs** are at `%APPDATA%\bb2dash\logs\main.log` (rolls at 512 KB, one
  previous generation kept). Every line is redacted first: no bearer token, anon
  key or cookie value is ever written. That is the first place to look when
  something does not happen.
* **Other state** in `%APPDATA%\bb2dash`: `window-state.json` (size and
  position), `notify-watermark.json` (what has already been notified about),
  `update-reminder.json` (the *Update later* time). Deleting them is safe; the
  app rebuilds all three.
* **Links to anywhere else** — a signed file URL from Materials, an outside link
  in an announcement — open in the default browser, not in the window.

## Updates

Only for the app as the logon builder installs it
(`%LOCALAPPDATA%\bb2dash-launch\current\bb2dash.exe`); a dev run or a
hand-packed build does none of this.

* **Builds without a logon.** At launch and every 6 hours
  (`BUILDER_INTERVAL_HOURS`) the app starts the `Bb2dash-LogonBuild` task, unless
  it is already running. The builder fetches, rebuilds only when `desktop/`
  changed, and never switches builds while the app is open.
* **The prompt.** The running build is the tree hash in the resolved path of the
  executable (`builds\<tree>\win-unpacked`). When the builder's `state.json`
  records a newer `lastBuiltSha` whose build is on disk, the next time a window
  opens a small bb2dash window appears over it: *A new version of bb2dash is
  ready* with **Update now** and **Update later**. *Update later* asks when to
  remind: **In 1 hour**, **In 4 hours** or **Tomorrow** (09:00 local). The
  choice is saved in `%APPDATA%\bb2dash\update-reminder.json`, and no prompt
  appears before then. Closing the prompt saves nothing; the next open asks
  again. It is never a native dialog, and under `BB2DASH_TEST=1` it is only
  recorded (`update-prompt` event).
* **Update now** runs `launch\update-now.ps1 -Detach` as a hidden child and
  waits up to 30 s for it to exit. That stage hands the helper off to a
  separate hidden PowerShell (`Start-Process`, so the helper outlives the app)
  and exits. The app quits only after the helper's `swap-pending` marker names
  the new build (20 s bound). If the hand-off fails or no marker appears, the
  app stays on its build and `main.log` says *Update now could not start the
  helper; staying on this build:* with the reason, for example
  *update-now.ps1 -Detach exited 6: no helper was started* or *the update
  helper did not start within 20000 ms: … ; a helper may still be running:
  see logs\update-now.log*. The helper waits for every bb2dash process to
  exit, points `current` at the new build and starts `Bb2dash-App`. If the
  build is missing or the junction cannot be moved, the old build stays
  current and the app starts on it; if the app never exited within 60 s,
  nothing is started. A helper refuses outright, touching nothing, while a
  fresh `swap-pending` names another build. Its log is
  `%LOCALAPPDATA%\bb2dash-launch\logs\update-now.log` (both stages); the app's
  side is in `main.log` under `[update]`.
* **Forcing an update.** Open the account menu (the person icon, top right) and
  click **Update desktop app**. It first checks Docker (`docker version`, 10 s
  bound); with Docker not running it answers at once *Update failed: Docker isn't
  running — start Docker Desktop and try again* and starts nothing. Otherwise it
  shows *Checking for updates…*, writes `force-request.json` so this builder run
  waits only 30 s for Docker (`APP_DOCKER_WAIT_SECONDS`; the logon run keeps its
  600 s), starts `Bb2dash-LogonBuild` (or joins the run already going) and waits
  for it: fetch 45 s + Docker wait 30 s + longest build 20 min + 2 min margin
  (`FORCE_UPDATE_TIMEOUT_MS`, about 23 minutes). A container build takes a few
  minutes, a no-change run a few seconds. If the wait runs out anyway, it says
  *Update failed: still building — it will offer the update when it finishes*:
  the build keeps going, and the usual prompt offers it at the next window open.
  Then:
  * a newer build is on disk: the app runs the same **Update now** path as the
    prompt (hand-off, helper swap, relaunch) and says *Updating — bb2dash will
    restart* only once the helper's marker has appeared. A failed hand-off or no
    marker answers *Update failed: the update could not start* and the app stays
    on its build;
  * nothing newer, and this run fetched `origin/main` and its `desktop/` tree is
    the running build: *Up to date*. It never says that when it could not look;
  * anything else: *Update failed: &lt;reason&gt;*. Docker not running while a
    build was needed (*Docker isn't running — start Docker Desktop and try
    again*), no fetch (*could not reach GitHub …*), the build failed, or the builder left no check of its own (an older installed builder;
    that goes away once a successful build refreshes the installed scripts).
    Details are in `logon-build.log` and `main.log`.

  What the builder could check is in `%LOCALAPPDATA%\bb2dash-launch\last-check.json`
  (`checkedAt`, `remoteTree`, `skip`: empty, `fetch-failed`, `ref-unresolved` or
  `docker-not-ready`), written at the end of every build step.

  The item appears only inside the desktop app; a normal browser never shows it.
  It reaches main through the preload's `requestUpdate()`, the one IPC call
  (`bb2dash:request-update`), which main answers only for the main window's top
  frame on the app origin. One request runs at a time; clicking again while one
  runs waits for the same answer. A dev run answers *Update failed: this copy is
  not an installed build*; under `BB2DASH_TEST=1` the request is only recorded
  (`update-request` event).

## Acceptance script

The six steps that say this phase is done, run from the unpacked build:

1. Double-click the shortcut: bb2dash opens in its own window with its own
   taskbar button, and you are still signed in.
2. Double-click it again: the same window is focused. No second window, no
   second process.
3. Close the window (the renderer process goes away) and reopen it from the
   tray: a new window, still signed in.
4. Trigger a sync: one "Sync landed with N changes" toast, with the right N.
5. Receive a "grade posted" and a "due tomorrow" toast naming the course and the
   item; clicking each raises the window on the right screen.
6. Press the Sync button in the app: Windows Terminal opens in the repo and runs
   `claude "/bb-sync <id>"`.
