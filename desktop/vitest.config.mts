/**
 * Vitest for the Electron shell's unit suite (C-10).
 *
 * `.mts`, like `web/vitest.config.mts`: this package is CommonJS (Electron's main
 * process and a sandboxed preload both need CJS) and Vite's native config loader
 * cannot read ESM syntax out of a file it treats as CJS.
 *
 * Node environment, not jsdom: everything under test is main-process or `core/`
 * code. Nothing in the suite touches the network. The PostgREST layer is exercised
 * through an injected `RestGet` stub or a stubbed `fetch`, and the Electron adapters
 * through the `BB2DASH_TEST=1` recorders, so no test can reach `*.supabase.co`.
