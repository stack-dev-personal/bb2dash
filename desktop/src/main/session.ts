 *  2. While the window is *visible* the page refreshes itself and there is nothing to do.
 *     Hidden to the tray (C-12) it does not: supabase-js stops its auto-refresh timer when
 *     the document is hidden, so an hour after hide-to-tray the cookie is stale and stays
 *     stale. So main reloads the hidden window, and the *web app* refreshes the cookie —
 *     `web/src/proxy.ts` runs on every route the shell can reach and calls
 *     `supabase.auth.getUser()` through a `createServerClient` whose `setAll` writes the
 *     rotated cookie onto the response (`web/src/lib/supabase/proxy-session.ts`). Main
 *     still never calls the auth API itself, so C-5 stands: this is a navigation, not a
