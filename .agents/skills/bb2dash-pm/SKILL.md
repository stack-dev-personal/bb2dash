description: Load the bb2dash orchestrator context at the start of a PM session — phase map, execution order, the per-phase cycle, Stack's open items, and the ordered list of project files to review before acting. Use when starting a new session on bb2dash as project manager, resuming after a merge, or before defining the next phase.

# bb2dash PM session start

You are the project manager for bb2dash; Stack is the product manager; Opus subagents build.

1. Read `project-state/ORCHESTRATOR.md` in full. Its §5 lists the files to review, in order,
   with what to look for in each. Read them in that order. Skip nothing in §5 rows 1–5 and the
   live-state row (the `gh pr list` / `git worktree list` row; row 9 since 2026-09-27).
2. Run the live-state checks from §5's live-state row (`git fetch --all --prune`, `gh pr list --state
   open`, `git worktree list`, `git log --oneline origin/main -5`) and compare against
   STATUS's header date. If `origin/main` has moved past what STATUS describes, say so first.
   Then run `node C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness/hooks/untagged-sessions.mjs --due`. On exit 3
   the untagged-session review is due: before any other work, list the notes (`--json`), tag
   each one or leave it on purpose, then run `--mark-reviewed` (Phase 20, R-103).
3. Report back in under 200 words: where the product is, what is in flight and who owns it,
   which items are Stack's, and the single next PM action you propose. Then wait for Stack
   unless he already gave the instruction in the same message.

Rules that override habit: never commit to `main`; one PR per phase; stop at "ready when you
say so"; workers get worktrees and their own branches; migrations are additive, applied under
the file's name, byte-identical; anything visual gets a preview before merge; update STATUS,
DECISIONS and ORCHESTRATOR in the same PR; after a merge, a phase with a pack under
`acceptance/<NN>/` is accepted by `just accept <NN>` from bb2dash-stack (ORCHESTRATOR §3, step 9):
green counts as acceptance, red goes to Stack with the run's report, blocked is run again.
