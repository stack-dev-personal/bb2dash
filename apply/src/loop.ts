/**
 * The worker, one pass (Phase 23). Every step that must not be left to a model is here, in code
 * (ORCHESTRATOR: "a skill step written as prose gets skipped"):
 *
 *   1. inbox_apply_claim(): releases dead claims, then claims the oldest queued request; none -> idle
 *   2. inbox_apply_prepare(id): apply_resolutions(), the queue, the day's run count
 *   3. archive, with a templated record, every row that needs no reading (`batch.ts`)
 *   4. at most six of the rest go to one `claude -p` run of /inbox-apply, unless the day's cap is
 *      reached; the run is killed at 14 minutes
 *   5. inbox_apply_run_facts(id): what the request did, read from the tables
 *   6. inbox_apply_close(id, done | failed, result): the close files the follow-up for the rest
 *
 * A pass that throws after its claim still closes the request, failed. If even that close cannot
 * be made (the database is gone), the claim is released by the next inbox_apply_claim(), which
 * closes any claim of the worker's own it finds open.
 *
 * Every step is an injected port, so the pass runs on fakes in loop.test.ts.
