/**
 * The embed call: `ingest/embed_corpus.mjs`'s `runEmbedLoop`, unedited, against `workspace-embed`
 * with the document's id added to every body (step 7). The loop's contract holds: `post` never
 * throws and returns `{status, body}`; a transport failure is a retryable 503.
 *
 * One try runs until every part of the document is stored (round 3): the loop's own 60-call budget
 * stops at 180 parts, and a document may hold well over a thousand. So the call budget here is a
 * backstop only, and two rules stop a try that cannot finish:
 *
 *   no progress  a 200 answer with `inserted_rows` 0 and `remaining_parts` above 0: the failed try it is.
 *                Progress is parts stored. `remaining_parts` is a lower bound while unmarked units lie
 *                outside the function's window (an unread unit counts as 1 until it is read), so it can
 *                rise between two passes that each stored parts; only 0 is exact, and one pass's count is
 *                never compared with another's
 *   timed out    the document's time bound (a deadline inside the claim's lease) has passed; the
 *                parts already stored stay (the units are not put again), so the next claim, which
 *                finds the document in `text_ready`, continues from them
