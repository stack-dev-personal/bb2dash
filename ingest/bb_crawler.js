/**
 * bb2dash :: bb_crawler.js
 *
 * Runs INSIDE a logged-in Blackboard Ultra tab (built-in Claude browser or devtools console).
 * Uses the same internal JSON endpoints the Ultra UI calls (/learn/api/v1/...), authorized by the
 * session cookie. Posts raw payloads to the Supabase landing table `bb_raw` with the anon key
 * (insert-only policy), so nothing round-trips through chat.
 *
 * Usage (in page context):
 *   const bb = installCrawler({ userId: '_21025199_1', supabaseUrl, anonKey });
 *   await bb.runAll();                 // crawls every current-term course + calendar, posts to bb_raw
 *   await bb.runAll({ termName: 'Fall 2026', runId });   // registered-first: the caller owns the run id
 *   await bb.crawl('_571529_1');       // one course, returns the payload
 *
 * Notes
 *  - Relative URLs fail from the Claude browser's exec context; always use absolute.
 *  - Navigating the tab wipes window state; extract/post before navigating.
 *  - Content children come back with `contentHandler: null` for folders; the real type is the key of
 *    `contentDetail`. Containers = hasChildren || type matches folder|lesson|learningmodule.
 *  - Ultra "documents" (type null) embed files as <a data-bbfile="{json}"> in body.rawText. Assessment items hide
 *    attachments under contentDetail.<asmt>.test.assessment.instructions — embedsDeep() scans every string field.
 *  - Only durable bbcswebdav URLs (…-rid-N_1/xid-N_1) survive the session; /sessions/… URLs 403 the next day.
 *  - bbcswebdav file URLs 302 to a cross-origin CDN with no CORS; bytes cannot be fetched from
 *    page JS. Catalog them (bb_files) and download manually or via the Learn public API with a token.
 *  - Public REST (/learn/api/public/v1/...) also answers with the cookie; prefer it for anything
 *    documented, fall back to /learn/api/v1 for gradebook/grades and calendarItems.
 *  - Announcements (/learn/api/v1/courses/{C}/announcements): the INTERNAL endpoint uses
 *    `createdDate` / `modifiedDate`; the PUBLIC one uses `created` / `modified`. Do not mix them.
 *    `modifiedDate` is proven against live payloads and feeds announcements.modified_at
 *    (migration 033). The creator key is `creatorUserId`, proven live (R-70, DECISIONS 2026-10-03:
 *    27 of 27 announcements carry an author after the v5 crawls, 26 from the course's teachers and
 *    1 through `/users/{id}`); see mapAnnouncement() below; the mapper tries every candidate and
 *    records the winner in `authorSource`, and v5's probe (below) records what the payload carries.
 *
 * PHASE 10a (crawler version 3) — the first versioned envelope
 *  - Every `kind = 'course'` payload now carries `crawler: { version: 3 }`. It is the first
 *    versioned envelope; the stages read a missing key as version 2 (migration 050).
 *  - `attempts(C, gradebook)` probes the columns that look like they have a submission and posts
 *    the frozen shape migration 050 reads:
 *      attempts: [{ columnId, contentId, endpoint, status, results: [{ id, status, created,
 *                   modified, submitted, score, feedback, studentComments, studentSubmission,
 *                   exempt, receipt, files: [{ id, name, size, downloadUrl }], keys: [...] }] }]
 *    `status` is the HTTP status of the attempts call; a failed probe is recorded with an empty
 *    `results`, never thrown, and the crawl carries on.
 *
 * PHASE 12b (crawler version 4) — the attempts chain, now that it is known
 *  v3 asked `GET .../gradebook/columns/<col>/attempts?userId=<me>`. For a STUDENT that answers
 *  `200 {"results": []}` on every column — 21 of 21 in crawl 1b5e8da5 — so v3 catalogued nothing
 *  and `bb_attempts` / the `my_submissions` bucket stayed empty. Blackboard's own UI never calls
 *  that route. The PM read the requests the Ultra gradebook page actually makes
 *  (docs/planning/sprint-1-hub/evidence/80f_ATTEMPTS_ENDPOINT.md); it walks THREE requests per column:
 *      1. `/gradebook/columns/<col>/grades?expand=attemptsLeft&userId=<me>`  -> the GRADE ID
 *      2. `/gradebook/columns/<col>/grades/<gradeId>/attempts`               -> the attempt rows
 *      3. `/gradebook/attempts/<attemptId>?columnId=<col>&expand=…`          -> the FILES
 *  Step 3 is the only one that carries `studentSubmissionFiles[]`, and each file's
 *  `file.permanentUrl` is an ordinary durable `bbcswebdav/xid-<n>_1` URL — the same kind bb-sync
 *  step 4 already pulls with the session cookie. v3's `downloadUrl` was BUILT, not read, and the
 *  route it built does not exist for a student.
 *  The envelope keeps v3's shape so migration 050/055 still reads it, and gains the chain:
 *      attempts: [{ columnId, contentId, endpoint, status, steps, keys: { grade, attempt, detail,
 *                   file }, grade: {…}, attempts: [{…}], detail: [{…}],
 *                   results: [{ id, status, created, modified, submitted, score, exempt, receipt,
 *                               files: [{ id, name, size, mime, uuid, downloadUrl }],
 *                               text: { studentSubmission, studentComments, instructorFeedback },
 *                               keys: [...] }] }]
 *  `results[]` is the contract the stage reads; `grade` / `attempts` / `detail` / `steps` / `keys`
 *  are the diagnosis. Bounded at the newest ATTEMPT_LIMIT (3) attempts per column, one request at
 *  a time. Every step records its own status and moves on: a failed step never throws the crawl.
 *  PROSE MOVED. Stack's typed-in submission, his comments and the instructor's feedback are now
 *  nested under `results[].text`, which the stage does not read into a column — so they live in
 *  `bb_attempts.raw` (owner-only, RLS) and nowhere else.
 *  WHAT THE LIVE CRAWLS PROVED (the counts: DECISIONS 2026-10-04, R-66 and R-75). The key lists
 *  keep names live v4 and v5 attempts carried. Never seen: `instructorFeedback` (the attempt sends
 *  `feedbackToUser`), `studentComments` (its one name kept for 085's contract), and any file size
 *  (bytes come from the pull, `bb_files.bytes`). A plain-string `feedbackToUser` is accepted by
 *  R-66, not yet seen live. Both `submitted` names stay: a step-2 list row has no receipt, only
 *  `attemptDate`. The prose is only under `results[].text`, so only in `bb_attempts.raw`. Key
 *  lists cut 2026-10-04 (Phase 18 task 19); a name no list keeps yields null, never a guess.
 *  - Assessment fields (`dueDate`, `points`, `gradebookColumnId`, `attemptsAllowed`): CLOSED
 *    (R-75, option (b)). The gradebook column is the source of due dates and points (migration
 *    034), the item link is `column.contentId` (084), and attempts allowed come from 055.
 *    `assessmentFields()` stays a probe that records `detailSource`; nothing reads its values.
 *
 * PHASE 18 (crawler version 5) — the probe (R-66, R-70, P-97)
 *  Every `kind = 'course'` payload carries
 *      crawler: { version: 5, probe: { announcementKeys: { <bb course id>: string[] },
 *                                       idShaped: [{ key, value }], misses: { <key-list name>: n } } }
 *  `announcementKeys` is the sorted union of the raw announcement keys, `idShaped` every
 *  `_NNNN_1` value under a dotted key path (never prose), and `misses` counts each key list that
 *  found nothing: `AUTHOR_KEYS` per announcement with neither a name nor a user id, and
 *  `ATTEMPT_FIELD_KEYS.<field>` / `ATTEMPT_FILE_KEYS.<field>` per attempt detail / file. A mapped
 *  announcement keeps a bare creator id as `authorUserId` beside `author` / `authorSource`; the
 *  id is never shown. Attempt feedback is read from `feedbackToUser` alone. The stages ignore
 *  `crawler.probe` and `authorUserId`; one query over bb_raw after the next sync reads them.
 *  Task 18 resolves `authorUserId` to a name: the course's teacher rows first, then one
 *  `GET /learn/api/v1/users/{id}` per distinct unresolved id per run (resolveAuthors). A resolved
 *  name lands in `author` with `authorSource` 'teachers' or 'users'; a failed lookup adds
 *  `userLookup` and each still-nameless post `authorUnresolved` to `misses`, and never throws.
 *
 * `runAll({ runId })` — REGISTER FIRST (Phase 19, migrations 135 and 136)
 *  `skills/bb-sync/SKILL.md` claims its request and sets `agent_requests.run_id` in one update,
 *  BEFORE the crawl, and passes that id here. The claim opens the run's `sync_runs` row as
 *  `running` (135), so Home says "sync running" while this is still walking courses. The order is
 *  safe because `transform_tick` (136) folds a REGISTERED run only once its `calendar` row is in
 *  `bb_raw`, and `runAll` posts that row last: a slow crawl is never folded part-way. Before 136
 *  the tick also folded a registered run after three idle minutes, with no completeness check,
 *  which is why the skill used to register after `runAll` returned (DECISIONS 2026-09-15,
 *  superseded by this phase's row).
 *  If the crawl dies (the tab closes, `runAll` throws) the calendar row never lands and nothing is
 *  folded. After 30 minutes the tick's terminal rule marks the run interrupted, closes the request
 *  as failed and raises one Inbox item. Nothing is retried: the next sync is a new run id.
 *  `runId` is validated as a uuid so a caller can never crawl under a fabricated id. With no
 *  `runId` the crawler names the run itself (devtools, tests); that crawl is folded only if a
 *  claimed sync request registers the id before the tick quarantines it.
 *
 * Testability: `strip`, `announcementAuthor`, `mapAnnouncement`, `mapAttempt`, `mapAttemptFile`,
 * `shouldProbeColumn`, `assessmentFields` and `assertRunId` are module-level pure functions,
 * exported under a CommonJS guard at the bottom so web/test can cover them. The guard is inert in
 * a browser tab, where this file is still pasted and run as-is.
