// bb2dash :: ingest/fetch_signed.mjs
//
// The byte fetch for a Blackboard file, without a browser download event.
//
// WHY THIS EXISTS. A `bbcswebdav` URL does not serve bytes: it 302s to a signed, time-limited CDN
// URL on another origin with no CORS headers, so page JavaScript cannot read it and only a real
// browser could follow it. The pull therefore used Playwright's `download` event — which crashed
// the MCP browser on 2026-09-23 and left a sync unable to store the three files it had catalogued.
// The chain is walkable by hand, one hop at a time, if something holds the session cookie: that is
// what this module does. It takes an injected `get` (Playwright's
// `APIRequestContext.get(url, { maxRedirects: 0 })`, which carries the logged-in context's cookies)
// so the walk is testable without a browser and reusable by the Phase 14 sync runner.
//
// WHAT IT REFUSES, AND WHY THAT MATTERS. A redirect chain is attacker-influenced in principle: it
// is whatever the remote server puts in `Location`. So the walk is bounded at MAX_HOPS and the
// final URL must sit on Blackboard's CDN suffix, checked at a domain boundary rather than by
// `endsWith` on the whole host. Bytes are never fetched from anywhere else, and `downloadTo`
// re-checks the host itself so a caller cannot hand it a URL the walk never approved.
//
// A signed URL is never cached past one run: it expires, and a stale one fails in a way that looks
// like a missing file.
//
// OUTCOMES, which every caller must tell apart:
//   ok              · the chain ended on the CDN; `signedUrl` is the thing to download
//   session_expired · 401/403 at the first hop: the Blackboard session died. The caller STOPS;
//                     retrying every remaining file would just produce a list of identical errors.
//   gone            · 404: the file is no longer on Blackboard. The row is left alone and reported.
//   refused         · too many hops, or a final host that is not the CDN. Reported, never followed.
//                     A redirect to a Blackboard host not on the allow-list is refused with the HOST
//                     named; so is one to an IP, localhost, a non-http(s) scheme or a link that
//                     cannot be stored.
//   offsite         · (164) a redirect to another SITE: `target` is the link to save. The target is
//                     never requested, since the walk carries the logged-in cookies.
//
// Importing this module runs nothing: every export is pure or takes its I/O by argument.
