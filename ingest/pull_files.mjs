// CADENCE_RUNBOOK step 4, the one step no automation replaced: store the bytes of the bb_files
// rows the transform catalogued with `storage_path is null`. First run 2026-09-22 (12 files).
//
// TWO CALLERS, ONE GATE. Course files are runbook step 4; Stack's own submitted files are bb-sync
// step 4b, catalogued by `stage_attempts` with `bucket = 'my_submissions'`. They differ in four
// small ways and nothing else: `--bucket my_submissions` selects them (with no flag the run takes
// course rows only, so neither caller can ever write the other's rows), their update keeps the mime
// Blackboard declared (`coalesce`, see below), their notes line names step 4b, and an occupied
// Storage key fails the row instead of counting as done. A manifest row with no `bucket` key —
// every manifest written before 2026-09-22 — is a course file.
//
// THE SHAPE. Two halves, because bbcswebdav URLs 302 to a cross-origin CDN with no CORS:
//   1. The browser half gets each file's bytes onto disk as `<id>_<name>` (`downloadNameFor`).
//      THE SYNC'S WAY (bb-sync step 4b, since 2026-10-01): the sync runs only in Stack's logged-in
//      Chrome through Claude in Chrome, which cannot read a redirect. The tab is navigated to
//      `<source_url>?xythos-download=true`, Chrome saves the file to its Downloads folder (an
//      inline PDF is saved by a same-origin snippet on the CDN page), and
//      `ingest/collect_download.mjs` moves it into --downloads. No signed URL ever passes through
//      the agent. Then this script runs WITHOUT `--fetch`.
//      THE FALLBACK (`--fetch`), only for a caller holding a Playwright-style request API and a
//      logged-in context: walk hops one at a time with `request.get(u, { maxRedirects: 0 })`
//      through `ingest/fetch_signed.mjs`'s `resolveSignedUrl` and write the `hops` array onto each
//      manifest row. Playwright's `download` event is never used: it crashed the MCP browser on
//      2026-09-23 and left a sync unable to store three catalogued files.
//   2. This script does the rest, per manifest row. Without `--fetch` it finds the `<id>_*` file
//      already in --downloads; with `--fetch` it validates the row's `hops` and downloads the
//      signed URL itself (a signed CDN URL carries its own authorisation, so no session is needed).
//      Then: check size and magic bytes, copy to the local mirror (`course context/<relpath>`),
//      POST to Storage `bb-files/<key>` with the publishable key (anon is insert-only, never
//      `x-upsert`; a Duplicate answer means the object is already there), run extract_text.py
//      under uv with its three libraries, store the units through `sync_file_text_put` (migration
//      200) as `sync_runner`, with the login the sync container uses (`ingest/text_put.mjs`;
//      Phase 25a, replacing the REST insert with the publishable key), and write the `update bb_files …`
//      statements to --out for the owner to run through execute_sql. Unless `--no-embed`, a run
//      that posted any unit finishes by calling `ingest/embed_corpus.mjs`'s loop, so the text it
//      just stored is actually searchable when the run ends.
//      A `gone` outcome (404) means the file is no longer on Blackboard: the row is left alone and
//      reported, and a human marks it `superseded_by` its replacement. A `session_expired` outcome
//      (401/403 on the first hop) stops the whole run: every remaining row would fail the same way.
//
// THE MODES, ALWAYS EXCLUSIVE. Course files (no flag) and Stack's submissions (`--bucket
// my_submissions`) each take their own rows and can never write the other's. Re-pulling a file
// whose stored bytes went stale is `--restale` then `--restale-post` (see the --restale block
// below): it replaces text already in the corpus, so it runs on its own rows and in its own runs,
// and it never puts document text into the owner SQL.
//
// THE MANIFEST. One JSON array from this query (execute_sql), saved to a file:
//   select jsonb_agg(jsonb_build_object('id', f.id, 'file_name', f.file_name,
//            'relpath', bb_file_relpath(f.id), 'mime', f.mime_type, 'source_url', f.source_url,
//            'bucket', f.bucket, 'attempt_id', f.attempt_id))
//     from bb_files f where f.storage_path is null and f.superseded_by is null
//      and f.source_url is not null and not bb_file_is_outside_link(f.source_url)
//      and f.outside_url is null;
//   An outside link (migration 161: an http(s) source_url off the Blackboard host; migration 164: a
//   Blackboard file whose link redirects to another site, bb_files.outside_url) is never pulled.
//   With `--fetch`, the Playwright fallback adds `hops` to every row before this script reads it.
//   `mime` may be null: it is then inferred from the extension. An optional `key` overrides the
//   Storage key (a re-upload of an already-stored file needs its own; see file 145). `attempt_id`
//   is carried for the operator's report only; nothing here reads it.
//
// STORAGE KEYS. Supabase Storage refuses any key character outside `STORAGE_KEY_VALID` (`#`, `%`,
// `~`, `[`, `]`, `"`, curly quotes, every non-ASCII letter): each one becomes `_` in every segment,
// never the `/` separators, while the mirror and `file_name` keep the real name and `storage_path`
// records the key. An occupied sanitised key is refused, not resumed (`occupiedKeyRefusal`).
// Nothing else is renamed — in particular the `attempt-<digits>/` segment migration 052 gives a
// submission relpath survives into the key, which is what keeps a pulled-back submission off the
// key of a file Stack staged under the same name.
//
// Importing this module runs nothing: every helper is pure and exported for pull_files.test.mjs.

// --restale: re-pull a row whose stored bytes went stale.
//
// `stage_files` (074 and its predecessors) appends `; stored bytes may be stale` to a row's notes
// when the instructor re-uploads a file under the same item (same content id and name, new rid).
// The stored bytes and their text may then be out of date. This mode re-fetches them.
//
// THE RULE IT KEEPS (PR #32's security review): professor-authored document text never lands in
// SQL an agent reads and hands to a privileged execute_sql. Text goes through sync_file_text_put
// (200) exactly as the normal pull stores it, as a parameter, never in SQL text. The owner SQL carries only ids, Storage keys, hashes, a mime shape, a date
// and this script's own constant wording, and each of those is shape-checked before it is written.
//
// WHY TWO RUNS. `bb_file_text` is unique on (file_id, unit_kind, unit_no) and `sync_runner` can
// only insert through sync_file_text_put, never update or delete, so the new units cannot be stored
// while the old ones are there, and only the owner can remove the old ones. So:
//   1. `--restale` fetches the bytes and hashes them. Unchanged bytes → owner SQL that only clears
//      the note. Changed bytes → a NEW Storage key (a `restale-<sha12>/` segment; the old object is
//      never overwritten and stays where it is), a mirror copy at that new path, the units staged
//      on local disk (`<downloads>/restale_units/<id>.json`), and one owner transaction per row:
//      delete the old units (their embeddings cascade), point the row at the new key and sha, and
//      replace the marker with a dated "re-pulled" note. Both statements are guarded on the old
//      sha, so a row that changed since the manifest was read is left alone. The transaction
//      opens with a guard that aborts unless storage.objects holds exactly these bytes at the new
//      key (md5 eTag + size): that is why an occupied restale key is resumed, never refused or
//      overwritten. A row that uploads but gets no units reports its orphaned key.
//   2. The owner runs that SQL through execute_sql.
//   3. `--restale-post` stores each staged file's units through sync_file_text_put, all or nothing
//      (one transaction, rolled back when any unit is already there), and runs the embed step. A unit
//      already there means step 2 has not run for that row yet; nothing is stored and the file stays
//      staged.
//
// THE MANIFEST for --restale adds three keys to the normal one (ids, hashes and a boolean only):
//   select jsonb_agg(jsonb_build_object('id', f.id, 'file_name', f.file_name,
//            'relpath', bb_file_relpath(f.id), 'mime', f.mime_type, 'source_url', f.source_url,
