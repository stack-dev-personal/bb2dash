# Planning docs — index

Every brief, research report, verification note and walk bb2dash has produced, filed by the
sprint that produced it. Filenames never change: a doc keeps its number and name for life, so
`68_PHASE10B_grade_model.md` means the same file whatever folder it sits in, and STATUS,
DECISIONS and the briefs can keep citing each other by number. Only the folder moves.

Live project state is **not** here — it lives in `project-state/STATUS.md` (where the product
is) and `project-state/DECISIONS.md` (why). This folder is the record behind them.

## The sprints

| Folder | When | Phases | PRs |
|---|---|---|---|
| `sprint-0-foundation/` | Sep 2 – 10, 2026 | 1–7: data syntax, Blackboard capture, search schema, embedding POC, retrieval MCP, GUI v1, retrieval polish | #1–#6 |
| `sprint-1-hub/` | Sep 10 – 22, 2026 | 8–12b plus the V-1 and V-2 streams: course dimension, sync loop, grades (10a/10b), planner + calendar (11/11b), Electron shell (12), the page pass (12b) | #7–#23 |
| `sprint-2/` | planned 2026-09-24, verified and decided 2026-09-27 (PR #28 merged) | `91_REQUIREMENTS_v3.md` · `research/92_*` (10) · `93_SPRINT2_RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS.md` (§5 = the question batch) · `94_SPRINT2_PHASES.md` · `briefs/95_`–`103_` (phases 15–22 and 14) · `105_BRIEF_VERIFICATION_2026-09-27.md` (three verification rounds, residual notes) · `106_SPRINT2_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` (run sheet, no calendar) | #26 (the prompt); #28 (the planning PR); execution #29–#139 (and bb2dash-stack #1–#10); **closed 2026-10-26**, record `121_SPRINT2_CLOSEOUT_2026-10-26.md` |

**Sprint 0** predates Requirements v2. Its Sep 8 research-and-direction round
(`10_`–`31_`) was superseded wholesale and sits under `superseded/` with a note saying so.

**Sprint 1** is the hub sprint: `60_REQUIREMENTS_v2.md` (R-01..R-26) is the scope it was built
against and `70_MVP_INDEX.md` holds Stack's MVP/DoD answers per phase. Both sit at the sprint
root because every subfolder cites them.

**Sprint 2** closed on 2026-10-26; `121_SPRINT2_CLOSEOUT_2026-10-26.md` is what shipped and what was carried out of it. It holds the sprint's requirements (`91_`), research (`92_*`, `93_`), phase plan (`94_`) and briefs (`95_`–`103_`), plus `82_PHASE14_containers.md` and its six research reports (the record behind Phase 14; `100_` supersedes its Contract). The used sprint 1 session prompts sit in `sprint-1-hub/104_SPRINT1_SESSION_PROMPTS.md`. `parked/` holds
`81_PHASE13_styling.md` — Phase 13 was **skipped by Stack on 2026-09-22**; the brief stays
because its carry-ins C-1..C-3 (phone-width overflow, rank weights per exam, favicon) are
still open and still listed inside it.

## The subfolder convention

| Subfolder | What goes in it |
|---|---|
| `briefs/` | A phase contract: why, the frozen contract, worker list, seams, out-of-scope, migration range. What a worker is handed. |
| `research/` | The comparables report written before a brief is frozen; each brief's DoD cites its own. |
| `verification/` | What a worker wrote when its stream finished: before/after evidence, applied-migration hashes, advisor diffs. Also the PM's integration notes. |
| `evidence/` | A measurement or investigation that decided something, standing apart from any one worker — the grade-method comparison, the attempts-endpoint chain. |
| `walks/` | A browser walk of the built product against its acceptance script, with its screenshot folder beside it. |
| `parked/` | A brief that is written but not being built. |

A sprint root holds only the documents the whole sprint answers to (its requirements, its MVP
index). Everything else goes in a subfolder.

## Starting a new sprint

A new sprint is a new `sprint-N-<name>/` folder with the same subfolders (create only the ones
you need). **The numbering inside a sprint continues the repo-wide sequence** — it does not
restart at 00. Sprint 1 ended at `82_`, so Sprint 2's next new document is `83_` or higher,
whatever folder it lands in. That way a number alone identifies a document forever, and the
map below never needs a disambiguating column.

## Not here

* `docs/inbox-decisions/` — the log of Stack's answered Inbox items and what each one changed
  in the data. It is an operating record, not a planning doc, and it stays where it is.
* `db/migrations/` — byte-frozen against what was applied to prod. Several migration comments
  still cite the **old** planning paths on purpose; the map below is how you follow them.
* `project-state/` — STATUS, DECISIONS and ORCHESTRATOR. Live state, not record.

## Old → new path map

Every path below is relative to `docs/planning/`. Moves were made with `git mv`, so
`git log --follow` works on every file.
