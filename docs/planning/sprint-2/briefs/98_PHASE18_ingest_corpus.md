# Phase 18 — Ingest and corpus: files pulled and embedded in the sync, attempts and announcements settled, search labels honest

Date 2026-09-24 · PM: the Fable session · Product manager: Stack
Requirements: R-60, R-61, R-62, R-63, R-66, R-67, R-68, R-69, R-70, R-72, R-73, R-74, R-75, R-77; S2-rag-1
PM-added steps: P-22, P-23, P-24, P-26, P-27, P-28, P-36, P-81, P-82, P-89, P-90, P-91, P-92, P-96, P-97
Branch `feat/ingest-corpus-18` · Worktree `bb2dash-wt-18` · Migration range **120–129** · One PR per phase (no exception taken)
Status: ~~PROVISIONAL until Stack answers 93 §5~~ **Frozen 2026-09-29** at the phase start: every B-row default by the
2026-09-27 delegation, B-42 kept the `db_test_runner` role (128 is written), plan 94 approved the same day.

**Recorded at the phase start (PM, 2026-09-29). Read this before any task row.**

*PR #32 (795bcf6, merged 2026-09-29 on Stack's word) delivered tasks 2, 3 and 15 and most of 4 ahead of this phase*
(DECISIONS 2026-09-29, "Every file a sync catalogues is pulled inside that sync" and "The byte fetch no longer uses a
browser download"). Their checks, run at L1 on `origin/main` de7c644: `node --test ingest/fetch_signed.test.mjs
ingest/embed_corpus.test.mjs ingest/pull_files.test.mjs` → 56 pass, 0 fail; every `waitForEvent('download'` grep → 0
(bb-sync, CADENCE_RUNBOOK, bb-course-pull, pull_files); `bb.downloadAll` → 0; "file bytes are not downloaded here" → 0;
`pull_files.mjs --fetch` → 1 and `embed_corpus.mjs --check` → 3 in the skill. So:

1. Tasks 2, 3 and 15 are **done**; no worker rebuilds them. Their RED lines are PR #32's history, and `98d` records this
   paragraph's GREEN lines instead.
2. Task 4 keeps **only `--restale`**, redesigned. PR #32's security review dropped the brief's version because it wrote
   professor-authored document text into a `.sql` file an agent reads and hands to a privileged `execute_sql` (prompt
   injection). The rebuilt `--restale` must never put document text into SQL an agent executes: text goes over
   PostgREST exactly as the normal pull posts it, and any owner SQL the script hands over carries only ids, keys and
   hashes. It still takes a new Storage key and never overwrites. The stale-marker text is read from prod rows 72 and
   144 as they are (PR #32 found the old strip matched no migration's wording). If step 4b in `skills/bb-sync/SKILL.md`
   needs a `--restale` line, W-49 adds it, and task 16's installed-copy step copies that branch file; otherwise the
   installed copy already equals `main`'s.
3. The first stop (task 16's gate) waits on tasks 4 (`--restale`) and 5 (crawler v5) only.
4. Task 27's greps read 3, 3 and 0 at L1 (GREEN, as the preamble says).

*105 §3's five notes, fixed here:* §Seams "Phase 17 ↔ 18" now matches brief 97; `eval_search.mjs` gains `--out`
(Contract); the robocopy check has a defined missing-folder branch (task 16, L7); the research path is written in full
(Contract, bb_url); migration 120 also sets `classified_by` and a confidence on file 151 (Contract row 120, task 6).
Per DECISIONS 2026-09-24 ("a brief may not cite a default as decided before then"), every default below is a proposal;
each becomes a DECISIONS row dated the day Stack answers, never the day this brief was drafted.

B-numbers are the item numbers of `93_SPRINT2_RESEARCH_SYNTHESIS.md` §5. Its §1.4 prose cites "B-39" for the
per-item URL and "B-33" for the iCal job; by §5's own list those are **B-38** and **B-32**. This brief uses §5.
Starts after Phase 15 merges (its runner, test role and search_path pin); runs beside Phases 16 and 17; Phase 19
starts after it (94 §2 rule 3).

**Answered by delegation 2026-09-27.** Stack delegated the 93 §5 answers and the plan approval to the PM; the DECISIONS rows of 2026-09-27 hold them. Of this brief's B-numbers (B-8, B-32, B-33, B-34, B-35, B-36, B-37, B-38, B-39, B-40), every one resolved to its default. The phase's PM strikes PROVISIONAL where a row says default and rewrites the B-table row where it says changed, at the session's start (ORCHESTRATOR §6).

## Why

Sprint 1 built the file pipeline in pieces and left the joins to hand work. `ingest/pull_files.mjs` stores, mirrors and
extracts, but only after a browser download, and embedding is a hand `embed-corpus` loop (R-60). Step 4b has never pulled
a file inside a `/bb-sync`; course files are pulled outside the sync on request, and on 2026-09-23 the Playwright
download event crashed the MCP browser, so files 155–157 came in by curl on signed CDN links. Stack's S2-rag-1 asks that
"all materials should be chunked and embedded". Prod says that is true today by hand (84 current files, 784 units,
1,545 parts, 0 units without an embedding) except file 68, a GEO.103 `.doc` with no text (R-61). Nothing checks it, and
nothing keeps it true after the next pull.

The same corpus has honesty defects Stack can see. ⌘K headlines speaker-note text with no label on three live units
(R-62, a CLAUDE.md hard rule). Materials and search return both copies of the IST.323 syllabus (files 2 and 151) and of
the IST.466 Week 3/4 schedule (74 and 149) (R-63). Week and session links on files were written once at seed time (16
weeks, 2 sessions), so the timeline prints "no files" on 143 of 145 sessions (R-67). Ten GEO.103 textbook chapters read
"On Blackboard — not pulled yet" (R-68). All 88 assignments have a null `bb_url` (R-69). The crawler's own probes are
still open: attempt feedback is read under the wrong key (R-66), no announcement has an author (R-70), meeting times have
no Blackboard source (R-73), and R-17's `slim()` clause was never closed (R-75). The iCal job writes an "ok" row every
day with no data (R-72). The search docs describe old shapes (R-74), and the palette's latency was last measured on 534
units (R-77).

Why now: Phase 14's container runner inherits this phase's fetch and embed step instead of rebuilding them (P-36, P-92).
`stage_files` is re-created once here before Phase 19 re-creates `stage_content` (DECISIONS 2026-09-17, row 158). The
five open Blackboard facts need Stack's Duo session, so they share one probe sitting (P-27). Phase 15's runner makes the
post-embed checks runnable from disk (P-24).

## Stack's calls this brief rests on

Every row is **PROVISIONAL**: the default is built unless Stack answers otherwise (DECISIONS 2026-09-23, and the
2026-09-24 row that forbids citing a default as decided).

| B | question (93 §5) | default taken | tasks that change if he answers otherwise |
|---|---|---|---|
| B-8 | S2-rag-1: must/should, acceptance, surface, who embeds | must; a background check the PM runs after each corpus change, no UI this sprint; embedding runs as a step of the pull (no new cron job); a committed eval runner with the golden set re-validated first | a UI surface → a new Phase 17 item (tasks 1, 3 unchanged); a drain instead → task 3 becomes a migration in this range plus a Vault-held anon JWT, task 15 loses its embed line |
| B-32 | iCal feed job (Q24) | retire: unschedule `bb2dash-ical-poll`, amend R-15's clause | keep → task 14 is replaced by a parser over the registered `kind = 'calendar'` payload (node-ical), after Stack pastes the share link |
| B-33 | GEO.103 textbook chapters (Q25) | ebooks behind Orange Instant Access → Off-platform; the phys.org link recorded; Huber (46) stays tagged | chapters really on Blackboard → migration 125 sets only reading 45's url; screenshot 06 changes |
| B-34 | two live copies; the three IST.352 decks (Q26) | keep both copies current (17/15, 18/19); link decks 31 / 47 / 32 to sessions 129 / 130 / 131 | supersede instead → 120 gains those rows; 123 drops the three hand links |
| B-35 | week and session links for files (Q27) | yes, its own ingest item outside V-1, per-course rules, one Inbox question when a file fits several sessions | no → tasks 10 and 11's session step drop (124 keeps the supersession step); task 24 still ships |
| B-36 | announcement author (Q28) | probe on the next sync; expect a resolvable `creatorUserId`; resolve from the course's teacher ids, then one `/users/{id}` per miss, cached per run; drop the author segment only if nothing is there | no new endpoint → task 18 resolves teacher ids only, the rest stay "not recorded"; nothing present → task 18's fallback drops the segment |
| B-37 | course files pulled inside the sync (Q29) | in the skill now, with the scripted signed-CDN fetch; Phase 14's runner inherits it | outside the sync → task 15 changes only runbook step 4; task 17 reads its counts after a runbook pull |
| B-38 | per-item Blackboard links (Q30) | build `bb_url` now from the public Ultra template; the tab confirms, it does not gate | wait for the tab → task 13 waits for 98a §2 (task 23 unchanged) |
| B-40 | one logged-in probe sitting (P-27) | with the next sync: announcement shape, per-item URL, meeting times, `feedbackToUser`, group-attempt files | separate sittings → tasks 18, 19 and 26 wait for their own; task 16 runs once per sitting |

One more PROVISIONAL dependency is Phase 15's, not this phase's: **B-42** (a `BB2DASH_TEST_DB_URL` connection string for a
`db_test_runner` role). Every `db/tests` check below runs through Phase 15's runner under that credential, and task 21's
live `token_budget.py` run reads it (task 22's live eval calls `search` with `SB_ANON_JWT`, not this DSN). Neither the
role nor `scripts/db-test.mjs` exists on 2026-09-24 (prod `pg_roles`, repo `main` a5042fa). **If Stack answers B-42
otherwise (PROVISIONAL, B-42), this paragraph is the whole change; no row repeats it.** On either other answer there is
no `db_test_runner` role, so migration 128 is not written, 129 carries no grant line, the RPC table's `db_test_runner`
grants go, and W-48's "plus 128" and §Workers' "then **128**" slot drop. *An owner-level DSN instead of the role:*
the runner checks and task 21's live run use that DSN with the same expected values, and L3's `--ping` expects
`db-test: connected as postgres` (brief 95 §Stack's calls, row B-42); nothing else changes. *No
credential:* L3's `.env.local` copy, `npm --prefix scripts ci` and `--ping` check drop; every "`<file>` PASS" check (tasks 1, 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 20, 22, 26's data branch, and task 19's
`phase12b_085_stage_attempts_v4.sql`, pasted after its loader `phase12b_load_fixture.sql` as one text) becomes one
`execute_sql` paste of the file expecting its `: PASS` row (task 1's RED expects its `FAIL …` exception with the same
letters and ids); §DoD's `node scripts/db-test.mjs` → exit 0 and L2's check become "each `db/tests/phase18_*.sql` pasted
returns its `: PASS` row"; task 21's unit tests stand, but its live run has no DSN, so no `over_budget` count is claimed
and open item 4 reports it as not run. Every other expected value in this brief is the same on all three answers.

Under B-34's default the two documents Blackboard itself posts in two live places (15/17, 18/19) keep **both** copies
current, so "one current copy" in this brief means one copy of each *replaced* document, not of every document.

## Contract (frozen when Stack approves the phase plan)

### Routes and screens

No new route and no new screen. Visible changes, all through existing screens:

* `/materials`: one current copy of each replaced document (R-63; 15/17 and 18/19 stay two copies under B-34's
  default); GEO.103 chapter tags (R-68, B-33's default).
* ⌘K palette (`web/src/components/shell/CommandPalette.tsx`, unchanged): notes text reaches it labelled (R-62, server side).
* Assignment popout (`?item=assignment:…`) and `/course/[id]/assignment/[...assignmentId]` ("Open in Blackboard ↗"),
  and the `/planner` popover ("Blackboard ↗", `PlannerItemPopover.tsx:296–305`): the button opens the item's own Ultra
  page when `assignments.bb_url` is set (R-69).
* `/course/[id]/classwork?view=timeline`: session rows show linked files; no "no files" line on a course with no
  session-linked files (R-67).
* Bell and `/announcements`: the author segment shows a name (R-70), or goes (B-36 fallback).

### RPC signatures

Grants are read from `pg_proc.proacl` at write time and re-asserted unchanged unless stated. The search functions'
`search_path` is the value Phase 15's pin gave them (prod today: `proconfig` null; pgvector lives in schema `extensions`).

| function (full signature) | mode | grants | migration |
|---|---|---|---|
| `public.hybrid_search_file_text(q text, query_embedding vector, p_model text default 'gte-small', p_course text default null, p_limit integer default 10, rrf_k integer default 50, p_min_similarity double precision default null, p_include_superseded boolean default false) returns table(file_id bigint, text_id bigint, course_id text, bucket file_bucket, file_name text, unit_kind text, unit_no integer, score double precision, similarity double precision, snippet text, part_no integer, snippet_source text)` — body replaced, arguments and columns unchanged | SECURITY INVOKER | as today (PUBLIC, anon, authenticated, service_role) or as Phase 15 left them | 121 |
| `public.search_file_text(q text, p_course text default null, p_limit integer default 20, p_include_superseded boolean default false) returns table(file_id bigint, text_id bigint, course_id text, bucket file_bucket, file_name text, unit_kind text, unit_no integer, rank real, snippet text)` — body replaced | SECURITY INVOKER | as above | 121 |
| `public.supersede_replaced_files(p_run_id uuid, p_sync_run_id bigint) returns jsonb` → `{examined, superseded, asked, older_run}` (new) | SECURITY DEFINER, `set search_path = public, pg_temp` | revoke all from public, anon, authenticated; execute to service_role; execute to `db_test_runner` in migration 128 (**PROVISIONAL**, B-42) | 122 |
| `public.file_week_no(p_course_id text, p_path text, p_file_name text) returns smallint` (new) | IMMUTABLE, INVOKER, `public, pg_temp` | revoke from public, anon; execute to authenticated, service_role; execute to `db_test_runner` in migration 128 (**PROVISIONAL**, B-42) | 123 |
| `public.link_file_sessions(p_sync_run_id bigint) returns jsonb` → `{files_examined, weeks_set, sessions_linked, ambiguous, attention_raised}` (new) | SECURITY DEFINER, `public, pg_temp` | service_role; execute to `db_test_runner` in migration 128 (**PROVISIONAL**, B-42) | 123 |
| `public.stage_files(p_run_id uuid, p_sync_run_id bigint) returns jsonb` — re-created from 074's body; `counts` gains `superseded_auto` and `session_links` | SECURITY DEFINER, `public, pg_temp` | service_role only (038) | 124 |
| `public.assignment_bb_url(p_course_id text, p_item_id text) returns text` (new) | STABLE, INVOKER, `public, pg_temp` | revoke from public, anon; execute to authenticated, service_role; execute to `db_test_runner` in migration 128 (**PROVISIONAL**, B-42) | 126 |
| `public.stage_assignments(p_run_id uuid, p_sync_run_id bigint) returns jsonb` — re-created from 084's body | SECURITY DEFINER, `public, pg_temp` | service_role only | 126 |
| `public.stage_courses(p_run_id uuid, p_sync_run_id bigint) returns jsonb` — re-created from 034's body (its only definition), **only if** 98a §3 finds meeting data | SECURITY DEFINER, `public, pg_temp` | service_role, plus execute to `db_test_runner` for 129's test (see 129's row; **PROVISIONAL**, B-42) | 129 |

Rules the bodies must keep:

* **Notes label (121).** A returned `snippet` either holds no text from at or after the unit's first `[notes]` marker,
  or starts with `[notes] ` and holds only text after it. A slice that spans the marker is headlined on the side that
  covers the tsquery (the pre-marker side on a tie). Row 41's cover-and-rank order and `part_no` meaning are unchanged.
* **Auto-supersession (122).** For a current `bb_files` row F (not `stack`, not `my_submissions`) whose `content_id` is
  in the newest registered crawl of its course while its `source_url` is not: if that item now carries exactly one file
  whose current row G ≠ F, set `F.superseded_by = G.id` and append a note naming the run. Several candidates, or a match
  by file name alone across items, raise one `stack_must_confirm` through `raise_attention(...)` and write nothing.
  Only the newest registered crawl writes (037's guard). It runs before the missing marker.
* **Week and session (123).** `file_week_no` holds the per-course rules Stack confirms under B-35. Drafted from R-67 (2):
  GEO.103.lecture `Week N`; IST.323 `Lecture #N - Week N`; IST.352 `WKnn`; no rule for IST.466 (its Wk tags name schedule
  versions), ECN.304, IST.471 or GEO.103.recitation. `link_file_sessions` fills only null `week_no` / `session_id` on
  current, non-`stack`, non-`my_submissions` rows. It links through `reading_id → readings.for_date = sessions.session_date`
  (`link_confidence` 1.0), else through a week with exactly one session (0.8, PM's constants, named in the migration). A
  week with several sessions gets one question, settled on a later fold exactly as 086 settles reading links.
  `storage_path` and `local_path` are never written.
* **bb_url (126).** `assignment_bb_url` returns `<origin of courses.bb_url>/ultra/courses/<courses.bb_id>/outline/assessment/test/<bb_item_id>?courseId=<courses.bb_id>&gradeitemView=details`
  when a `bb_content` row for `(course_id, bb_item_id)` has `bb_type = 'resource/x-bb-asmt-test-link'` (37 rows today),
  and null otherwise (1 survey-link, 3 with no content row, 16 column-only) until 98a §2 shows another segment. The
  match is an `exists` test, never a join: 3 of the 37 test items carry two `bb_content` rows each (the rename ghosts
  P-25 collapses in Phase 19), and a join would double-count them. The stage writes it only where `bb_url is null` and
  never overwrites an Inbox-confirmed value. A new column's insert carries `bb_item_id = column.contentId`. Template
  source: `docs/planning/sprint-2/research/92_RESEARCH_sprint2_ingest-data.md` §8 "R-69 · Each Blackboard assessment links to its own Ultra
  page" (its tenant-survey bullet, the `…/outline/assessment/test/…` shape for tests); origin from `courses.bb_url` (all seven are
  `https://blackboard.syracuse.edu/ultra/courses/<bb_id>/outline` on 2026-09-24).

### Tables and migrations

Additive only. Each file is dry-run inside `begin; … rollback;`, then applied with `apply_migration` under the file's
name, and the repo file stays byte-identical to what was applied. No table is created. Nothing here touches
`stage_content`, `bb_content`'s keys, `transform_tick`, `run_transform`, `stage_gaps`, `v_course_stream` or `v_content_tree`.

| # | file | creates / changes |
|---|---|---|
| 120 | `db/migrations/120_supersede_file_chains.sql` | data: `bb_files` 2 → 151 and 74 → 149 (`superseded_by`, note citing `bb_raw` run 3b5174b8 and row 171); `bb_files` 151 `bucket = 'syllabus_policy'`, `classified_by = 'agent'` and `classification_confidence` set to file 2's value (105 §3: 151 is `rule` / 0.6 today, and a bucket moved by hand must not claim the rule classifier put it there) (prod 2026-09-27: `unclassified`, so without it IST.323's syllabus bucket would hold only file 3, the Student Policies appendix, and `resolveSyllabusFiles` in `web/src/lib/queries.materials.ts` would pick that appendix as the syllabus); `courses.syllabus_path = 'IST.323/323Fall26V1.4.docx'` for IST.323 (prod 2026-09-27: `IST.323/323Fall26V1.3.1.docx`; brief 96 §Seams, Phase 18 row, leaves both tables to this phase); a guard raises unless exactly 3 `bb_files` rows and 1 `courses` row change (P-26) |
| 121 | `db/migrations/121_search_notes_label.sql` | `create or replace` of both search functions under the notes rule (R-62). **Only if** task 8's rule fires, it also adds `bb_text_embeddings.part_fts tsvector` (new), filled by a BEFORE INSERT trigger from `bb_file_text` through `part_range` (a generated column cannot read another table, so this departs from 93 §1.10's "generated column"; 91 R-77 (2) allows the trigger), backfilled, and read at both `to_tsvector` sites (R-77) |
| 122 | `db/migrations/122_supersede_replaced_files.sql` | `supersede_replaced_files` (R-63) |
| 123 | `db/migrations/123_file_week_session_links.sql` | `file_week_no`, `link_file_sessions`; hand links 31→129, 47→130, 32→131 (B-34); backfill `link_file_sessions(null)` with a guard on its counts (R-67) |
| 124 | `db/migrations/124_stage_files_rules.sql` | `stage_files` re-created: 074's steps plus the supersession step (before the missing pass) and the session step (after `link_reading_files`) |
| 125 | `db/migrations/125_geo103_reading_routes.sql` | data: `readings.on_blackboard = false` for 39, 41, 44, 49, 52, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62; `readings.url` for 45 from `bb_content` 114; notes cite B-33 (R-68) |
| 126 | `db/migrations/126_assignment_bb_url.sql` | `assignment_bb_url`; `stage_assignments` re-created; backfill (R-69) |
| 127 | `db/migrations/127_retire_ical_poll.sql` | `cron.unschedule('bb2dash-ical-poll')`; `ical_poll` / `ical_collect` and `app_settings.ical_*` left in place (R-72) |
| 128 | `db/migrations/128_db_test_runner_phase18_grants.sql` | always written, **PROVISIONAL** on B-42 (Phase 15's `db_test_runner` is new in its migration 100 and absent from prod `pg_roles` on 2026-09-24; if B-42 is answered otherwise there is no role and 128 is not written). `grant execute on function supersede_replaced_files(uuid, bigint), link_file_sessions(bigint), file_week_no(text, text, text), assignment_bb_url(text, text) to db_test_runner`: 122 and 123 grant the first two to `service_role` only, the last two go to `authenticated`, which the role holds `with inherit false`, and the role is no `service_role` member (brief 95), so tasks 9 and 10's tests would fail with permission denied without it. `grant update on bb_files to db_test_runner` (a no-op if 100 already holds it; 100 derives its writes from today's tests, which only insert into `bb_files`), because task 9's test un-supersedes 2 and 74 as the session role. Select on every table and execute on the three search functions already come from 100, so 128 repeats neither; it grants nothing on `cron` (brief 95's frozen role holds nothing there). Applied right after 126 and 127, before the GREEN runs of tasks 9, 10 and 13 (§Workers order) |
| 129 | `db/migrations/129_stage_courses_meetings.sql` | **only if** 98a §3 finds meeting times: `stage_courses` writes `meetings` under source + confidence (a differing confirmed row raises a conflict, never an overwrite), and `grant execute on function stage_courses(uuid, bigint) to db_test_runner` for 129's test (a no-op if 100 holds it; the grant rides here, not in 128, because 128 is applied before 98a §3 is known, and `create or replace` keeps it). The grant line is **PROVISIONAL** on B-42, as 128 is: if B-42 is answered otherwise there is no role, the line is not written, and 129 carries only the `stage_courses` change; otherwise unused |

### Scripts, environment and payload contracts

* `ingest/fetch_signed.mjs` (new, pure, importable by the Phase 14 runner): `SIGNED_HOST_SUFFIX = '.content.blackboardcdn.com'`,
  `MAX_HOPS = 3`; `validateHops(hops)`; `resolveSignedUrl(get, durableUrl)` walks redirects one hop at a time through an
  injected `get(url) → {status, headers}` (Playwright's `APIRequestContext.get(u, { maxRedirects: 0 })`); `downloadTo(fetchImpl,
  signedUrl, destPath)` writes to a temp file, then renames, with copy-then-unlink on `EXDEV`. A signed URL is never cached
  past one run. Outcomes: `ok` · `session_expired` (401/403 on hop 1) · `gone` (404) · `refused` (hop count or host).
* `ingest/pull_files.mjs` gains `--fetch` (each manifest row carries `hops: string[]` recorded by the browser half; the
  last is the signed URL; the script validates and downloads it), `--restale` (rows noted `stored bytes may be stale`:
  a new Storage key, never an overwrite; `--out` gets one `begin; delete from bb_file_text where file_id = …; insert …;
  update bb_files …; commit;` per row, note cleared) and `--no-embed`. After a non-dry run that posted any unit it runs
  the embed step.
* `ingest/embed_corpus.mjs` (new): `node ingest/embed_corpus.mjs [--check] [--max-parts 3] [--budget 60]`. It loops
  `embed-corpus` until `remaining_parts = 0`, retrying 546/503 within the call budget. It exits 1 on a non-empty `failed`
  or an exhausted budget. `--check` sends `dry_run: true`, prints `missing_parts_before=<n>` and exits 1 when n > 0.
* `SB_ANON_JWT` (new env name): the legacy anon JWT that `embed-corpus` and `search` need (`verify_jwt` on).
  `embed_corpus.mjs` and `eval_search.mjs` refuse a value that starts `sb_publishable_`. `SB_ANON_KEY` keeps its meaning
  for Storage and REST inserts.
* `ingest/token_budget.py` (new): `uv run --with tokenizers --with "psycopg[binary]" python ingest/token_budget.py`.
  It reads `BB2DASH_TEST_DB_URL` (Phase 15) the way the runner loads it: from the process environment, or else from
  `.env.local` at the root of the checkout the script lives in (the worktree's copy, L3), parsed by the script itself so
  the command above needs no extra package. It rebuilds each current part's embedded input (header + `part_range` slice)
  and tokenizes it with `thenlper/gte-small`'s tokenizer. It prints `parts=<n> max_tokens=<n> over_budget=<n>` and exits 1
  when any part exceeds 512 tokens, [CLS] and [SEP] included.
* `ingest/eval_search.mjs` (new) over `ingest/eval/golden_set.json` (new; rows `{qid, course, query, type, truth:
  {text_ids, file_ids}, answer_phrase}`, the ten queries of `EVAL_EMBEDDING_POC.md` §2). It runs each query in `fts`,
  `vector` and `hybrid` with limit 10 and scores hit@1/3/10 and MRR. It takes `[--out <path>]` (default
  `ingest/eval/reports/<YYYY-MM-DD>.json`) and writes the report there,
  prints `scored=30` and exits 1 if hybrid MRR < 0.900 (PM's bar; the 2026-09-09 baseline is 0.950).
* Crawler envelope v5 (`ingest/bb_crawler.js`): `payload.crawler = { version: 5, probe: { announcementKeys: { <bb course id>:
  string[] }, idShaped: [{ key, value }], misses: { <key-list name>: number } } }`. A mapped announcement carries
  `authorUserId` beside `author` / `authorSource`. `GET /learn/api/v1/users/{id}` is called at most once per distinct
  unresolved id per run. `ATTEMPT_FIELD_KEYS.feedback` tries `feedbackToUser` first; attempt prose stays under `results[].text`.

mirror copy adds files to it and never deletes one). Not changed: `supabase/functions/embed-corpus/index.ts`
(no redeploy), `web/src/lib/supabase/database.types.ts` (no RPC signature changes; `assignments.bb_url` already exists).
Worker ownership is disjoint; see §Workers.

### Seams

* **Phase 15 → 18.** The runner `node scripts/db-test.mjs` (new in Phase 15, not on disk at `main` a5042fa; 94 §3's
  name, which brief 95 freezes) sends each `db/tests` file as one unit (after its loader, if its frozen loader map names
  one) and exits 1 on any FAIL (P-99). The runner does not wrap a file in a transaction; brief 95 §"RPC signatures,
  functions, the role, and the runner's command contract" (its "Pass rule" and "Lint, before connecting (exit 2)"
  bullets) sets what every new `db/tests` file here must do: start with `begin;`, end with `rollback;`, hold no top-level
  `commit` or `end` (else lint refuses it with exit 2 before connecting), and on success return one row whose first
  column ends in `: PASS` (a unit that raises nothing but returns no such row fails). Credential `BB2DASH_TEST_DB_URL`
  for the `db_test_runner` role (P-31, P-100; both new in Phase 15, and PROVISIONAL on Phase 15's B-42; §Stack's calls
  says what changes on its other answers). The search_path pin on `hybrid_search_file_text` and `search_file_text` (121 copies
  Phase 15's value). Any new function sets its own `search_path`, so the advisor count Phase 15 brought to 0 stays 0.
* **Phase 17 ↔ 18 (parallel).** R-56 (17) closes the `files_without_bytes` gaps that `stage_gaps` raises before the
  in-sync pull lands bytes; this phase does not re-create `stage_gaps`. R-58 / P-72 (17) decide whether `stage_files`'
  new `superseded_auto` / `session_links` counts become Activity lines. R-47's staging proof is 17's. 17 owns the
  `v_course_stream` / `v_content_tree` migrations. Both phases touch `CourseScreen.tsx` (brief 97 edits neither
  `AssignmentDetailBody.tsx` nor `PlannerItemPopover.tsx`, so those two are this phase's alone): named hunks only. Both
  add entries to `DATA_SYNTAX.md`, in different sections. The second to merge merges `main` in (a pushed branch is
  never rebased) and re-runs `cd web && npx eslint . --max-warnings 0`. On B-36's
  fallback only, W-51 also edits `web/src/lib/queries.announcements.ts`, `web/src/components/shell/Bell.tsx` and the
  not-recorded cases of `web/test/Bell.test.tsx` (all three are Phase 17's W-47 files: brief 97 T-23, and brief 97
  §Files, row "W-47 shell", which lists `Bell.test.tsx`), plus `web/src/components/announcements/AnnouncementsList.tsx` and the not-recorded
  cases of `web/test/AnnouncementsList.test.tsx` (brief 97 names neither), all under the same named-hunk rule.
* **18 → 19.** `stage_files` is re-created once here; 19 re-creates `stage_content` and does not touch `stage_files`.
  This phase leaves `stage_content`'s body unchanged (task 11 checks it with md5). 126 reads `bb_content.bb_type`, which
  already carries Blackboard's handler, so R-69 does not wait for 19's `contentHandler` carry (P-95); 19's key change must
  keep `bb_type`. 19's driver migration may drop the `ical_collect()` call from `transform_tick`, which 127 makes a no-op.
* **18 → 14.** The runner imports `ingest/fetch_signed.mjs` (passing Playwright's request context) and runs
  `ingest/embed_corpus.mjs` after its pull (P-36; P-92 closes P-37 by reference). It injects crawler v5. Its sync image
  needs `uv` plus `extract_text.py`'s three libraries, and not antiword or tokenizers (both PM-run here). Brief 100's
  §Seams "Phase 18" already names these; task 27 verifies it.
* **Sprint 1 objects kept as they are:** 074's `stage_files` steps, `link_reading_files` (086's settle pattern),
  `raise_attention(p_sync_run_id bigint, p_kind text, p_course_id text, p_entity text, p_ref text, p_field text, p_from jsonb,
  p_to jsonb, p_question text, p_suggested jsonb) returns boolean`, 084's `stage_assignments` steps, `bb_file_relpath`
  (reads `week_no`; stored keys are never rewritten), `v_bb_files_current`, the three RPCs' superseded filter,
  `embed-corpus` v5, `match_file_text`.

### Must respect

Quotes dated `[YYYY-MM-DD]` are verbatim from `project-state/DECISIONS.md` (checked by fixed-string match, 2026-09-24);

## MVP (in Stack's words)

What Stack wrote, and where:

* S2-rag-1 (`91_REQUIREMENTS_v3.md` §3, entry "S2-rag-1", its "what (Stack's words)" field): "rag testing (all
  materials should be chunked and embedded)". His
  why, must/should, acceptance and must-not fields are still "_to confirm_"; B-8 proposes them.
* GEO readings (80c P-materials-2, `80c_PHASE12B_page_pass.md:84`): "off-platform but in bb should be pulled and changed
  to in library if possible, external if possible as well".
* GEO readings (80c answer 17, `:145`): "GEO.103's daily reading-question documents and the readings **are files on
  Blackboard**." B-33's default reads the ten chapters as the exception to this; he confirms or reverses it.

Everything below is **PM wording (PROVISIONAL)**, built from 93 §5's defaults B-8, B-33, B-34, B-36, B-37 and B-38, not
Stack's words. After one sync from the phase branch, every file Blackboard shows is stored, extracted and embedded
before the sync reports, with no hand step and no browser download event. ⌘K never shows speaker notes as slide text.
Materials and search show one current copy of each replaced document (the IST.323 syllabus, the IST.466 schedule); the
two documents Blackboard posts in two live places keep both copies. Each Blackboard test's link (the popout's "Open in
Blackboard ↗", the planner popover's "Blackboard ↗") opens its own page. Announcements name who posted them, or the line goes. The GEO.103 textbook chapters read "Off-platform". A
committed check says the corpus is whole, and a committed eval says hybrid search still finds the ten known answers.

## Definition of done

Definition of done = the SOP gates below + Stack's acceptance script, walked on the Vercel preview, signed off once at
the PR (DECISIONS 2026-09-14). SOP gates (PM ticks each with its evidence in the PR body):

- [ ] **Plan gate:** Stack has answered 93 §5 (or said "defaults") and approved `94_SPRINT2_PHASES.md`; this Contract is
      frozen and its PROVISIONAL rows are rewritten to his answers before any worker starts.
- [ ] Every row of §Task list passes its check; evidence (test output, SQL result, screenshot path) is in the worker's
      `98c`–`98f` verification note, `98a`, or the walk note `98w`. Each code task's check was run and seen **failing
      first** (RED), and the RED output is in the same note.
- [ ] `web`: `npm run typecheck`, `npm run build`, `npx vitest run` → 0 failures, test count not below `main`'s.
      `mcp-server`: `npm test` → 0 failures (search result shapes unchanged). `node --test ingest/*.test.mjs` → 0 failures.
      `node scripts/db-test.mjs` → exit 0. `desktop/` is untouched.
- [ ] `/code-review main high`: CRITICAL and HIGH cleared. `/security-review` is **required**: new outbound fetches
      (signed-CDN host allowlist), a new Blackboard endpoint (`/users/{id}`), four SECURITY DEFINER bodies, a URL
      rendered from the database into an `href`, and owner SQL that deletes and reinserts text units.
- [ ] `get_advisors` (security): `function_search_path_mutable` → 0.
- [ ] `project-state/STATUS.md` (shipped, corpus counts, known-issue rows struck with their migration), `DECISIONS.md`
      (the 15 rows below on defaults) and `ORCHESTRATOR.md` updated in the PR. Brief 100's Phase 18 seam verified (task 27).
- [ ] Workers pushed per task on their branches; the PM merged them into `feat/ingest-corpus-18`; nothing committed to
      `main`. Every migration applied under its file name after a begin…rollback dry run, repo file byte-identical to
      what `list_migrations` shows.
- [ ] PR open on `feat/ingest-corpus-18`; Vercel preview URL answers 200. Stack sees the preview before merge.
- [ ] **Merge and the `search` redeploy only on Stack's word** in that conversation; otherwise the phase stops at
      "ready when you say so". After the redeploy (moved here from task 25, since it can only pass after merge):
      `get_edge_function('search')` source equals `supabase/functions/search/index.ts` on `main`, byte for byte once
      CRs at line ends are ignored (the checkout is CRLF under `core.autocrlf=true`).

DECISIONS rows owed (each tagged `Phase 18 · <id>`, each dated the day Stack answers its B-number, per the 2026-09-24

Stack's acceptance script (he walks it on the preview; the B-number after a step is the default it shows, and the step
changes if he answers otherwise):

0. He files the sync request with the Sync button of the web app in a browser tab, which inserts the request and copies
   the command. During this phase he never uses the desktop app's Sync button: that button itself runs
   `claude '/bb-sync <id>'` in Windows Terminal at `config.repoDir`, the main checkout on `main`
   (`desktop/src/core/config.ts:27`, `desktop/src/core/sync-command.ts:56` and `:84–85`,
   `desktop/src/main/sync-terminal.ts:194`), so it would run `main`'s old skill and scripts; the desktop route is proven
   only after merge. He runs the sync by hand from the phase worktree: `wt -d C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-18`,
   then `claude "/bb-sync <id>"` in that terminal (task 16's pre-gate check reads its working directory). He logs in to
   Blackboard in the Playwright tab when asked, and stays about 15 minutes while the PM opens five things in that tab
   (task 16; B-40). After the sync the PM copies the files it mirrored into `bb2dash-wt-18/course context/` over to the
   main checkout's `course context/` (task 16). Once task 18 is on the phase branch he runs a second sync the same way
   (L7; skipped on B-36's fallback), which is the crawl step 5 reads.
1. He reads the sync report: "N file(s) pulled and embedded", and no file named as not pulled (B-37).
2. `/materials` → IST.323: one syllabus, `323Fall26V1.4.docx`. IST.466: the Wk4xyz schedule, not the Wk3 one (P-26).
3. ⌘K "supplicant": the IST row shows "speaker notes hidden" (or "This slide is speaker notes only — hidden.") and no
   notes sentence as slide text (R-62).
4. `/planner` → an IST.323 due item → the popover's "Blackboard ↗" opens that item's own Ultra page, not the course
   outline (B-38).
5. The bell, after the second sync of step 0: each announcement shows a person's name (or no author segment at all, if
   B-36's fallback ran) (B-36).
6. `/materials` → GEO 103: the ten textbook chapters read "Off-platform" with the syllabus link; the phys.org article
   opens (B-33).
7. IST.352 → Classwork → Timeline: 8/26, 8/31 and 9/2 each list their SA&D deck (B-34, B-35).
8. The PM shows him `98a` (five `## §` answers) and today's eval report (hybrid MRR ≥ 0.900; B-8).

What proves each requirement:

* R-60: task 17's three counts are 0 after an in-sync pull, and task 15's greps show the download event is gone.
* R-61: file 68 `extracted`, and `phase18_post_embed_checks.sql` (a)–(c) PASS.
* R-62: `phase18_121_search_contract.sql` PASS, and `phase18_post_embed_checks.sql` (d) PASS on the three live leaks.
* R-63: 2 → 151 and 74 → 149 on prod; `phase18_122_supersede_rule.sql` reproduces exactly those two from the crawl.
* R-66: `_3610995_1`'s attempt keeps its `instructorFeedback`; the crawler header has neither "STILL UNVERIFIED" nor
  "ALSO NOT" (task 19's two greps).
* R-67: `phase18_123_file_sessions.sql` and `phase18_124_stage_files_replay.sql` PASS; screenshot 07.
* R-68: the ten readings are `on_blackboard = false`, and reading 45 has its url.
* R-69: 37 per-item URLs; `blackboard-link.test.ts` green; screenshots 03 and 04, and 04's DOM-read `04 href:` line in
  `walks/walk-18/98w_PHASE18_WALK.md` (task 28).
* R-70: no announcement present in the second sync's crawl (`<run2>`, L7, after task 18 merged) has a null author
  after its fold (or, on the fallback, `AUTHOR_NOT_RECORDED` is gone from `web/src`).
* R-72: `bb2dash-ical-poll` is gone from `cron.job` (an `execute_sql` read, task 14).
* R-73: 98a §3 answers it, and its DECISIONS row exists on either branch (plus 129's test PASS on the data branch).
* R-74: task 25's grep counts are all 0.
* R-75: its DECISIONS row, plus the crawler header grep.
* R-77: four medians in `98c`, and the ≤ 1.25× rule holds.
* S2-rag-1: tasks 1, 3, 21 and 22 green on prod data.

## Task loops

The phase cycle (the sprint 1 shape, 80c §Task loops), with the check that closes each step:

| # | step | executable check | owner |
|---|---|---|---|
| L1 | Stack answers 93 §5 and approves 94; the PM rewrites §Stack's calls and freezes the Contract, and records task 27's already-green greps | no row of §Stack's calls still reads "default taken" without his answer beside it | PM + Stack |
| L2 | Phase 15 merged: runner, test role, search_path pin | `node scripts/db-test.mjs` exits 0 on `main` | PM |
| L3 | Worktrees `bb2dash-wt-18` and the four worker worktrees cut from `feat/ingest-corpus-18`; the PM copies `C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash/.env.local` (gitignored, the canonical copy: brief 95 §"RPC signatures, functions, the role, and the runner's command contract", its "Credential" bullet) into `bb2dash-wt-18` and each worker worktree, deletes each copy with its worktree, and runs `npm --prefix scripts ci` in each (the runner's one dependency, `pg`) | `git worktree list` shows the five; each worker branch pushed; in each of the five worktrees, after the copy: `npm --prefix scripts ci` → exit 0, then `node scripts/db-test.mjs --ping` → `db-test: connected as db_test_runner`, exit 0 | PM |
| L4 | Per task: write the check, run it and see it **fail**, build, run it and see it **pass**, push `feat(18-<n>): …`, paste both outputs into the verification note | each §Task list row has a RED and a GREEN line in `98a` or `98c`–`98f` | workers |
| L5 | PM check of each finished row; a row that fails goes back to its worker with the failing output | the row's check re-run by the PM gives the same result | PM |
| L6 | **Sync gate and probe sitting** (task 16) once tasks 2–5 and 15 are merged into the phase branch; first the PM copies `skills/bb-sync/SKILL.md` from `feat/ingest-corpus-18` (with `git show`, task 16) over the installed `C:/Users/stack/.claude/skills/bb-sync/SKILL.md`, which is the copy `/bb-sync` loads; Stack runs the sync by hand from `wt -d C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-18`, never from the desktop Sync button; after it the PM copies the worktree's mirrored files into the main checkout's `course context/` | task 16's checks: the installed-copy `git diff --no-index --ignore-cr-at-eol --quiet` → exit 0 and the sync terminal's working directory is `bb2dash-wt-18` before the sync, then the three gate checks and the mirror-copy check | Stack + PM |
| L7 | Post-gate tasks 17–22 and 26; integrate; full suites. **Second sync**, once task 18 is merged into the phase branch and before task 28 (skipped on B-36's fallback, which needs no crawl): the PM updates `bb2dash-wt-18` to `feat/ingest-corpus-18`, and Stack (Duo) files and runs one more `/bb-sync` exactly as task 16 does (web-app Sync button in a browser tab, then `wt -d C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-18` and `claude "/bb-sync <id>"` by hand; never the desktop Sync button). Its run and request ids go into `98a` as `<run2>` and `<request2>`; task 18's live line, the R-70 proof and screenshots 05 and 08 read that run. After it the PM repeats task 16's mirror copy, recording the new count in `98a` as `mirror_files_run2=<n>` | §DoD test-suite box; for the second sync, in its terminal before `claude`: `(Get-Location).Path` (PowerShell) → `C:\Users\stack\projects\bb2dash-wt-18`, or `pwd` (Git Bash) → `/c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-18`, and `git rev-list --count --fixed-strings --grep="feat(18-18)" HEAD` → ≥ 1; after it, `select count(*) from bb_raw where run_id = '<run2>' and kind = 'course' and (payload->'crawler'->>'version')::int = 5` → 7 and `select state from agent_requests where id = <request2>` → `done`; after the copy, task 16's `robocopy … /E /L /NJH /NDL /NFL` check → its `Files :` row reads `Total` = `mirror_files_run2`, `Copied` 0, `FAILED` 0 | PM + workers; Stack for the second sync |
| L8 | PM walk (task 28), gates and docs (task 29), PR with preview | §DoD SOP boxes | PM |
| L9 | **Stack's acceptance script** on the preview; merge and `search` redeploy only on his word | each numbered step ticked by Stack | Stack |

## Task list

Checks name a test file with its command, a SQL assertion with its expected value, a count, a screenshot or an HTTP
status. `<run>`, `<request>` and `<date>` are filled from the gate sync, and `<run2>` and `<request2>` from L7's second
sync, all written into `98a`. No check contains a
shell pipe (a `|` inside a table cell is ambiguous when copied): greps are `grep -c` / `grep -cF` on one file, or
`git grep` with its exit status. "Today" counts were read at `main` a5042fa on 2026-09-24, so every grep check is RED
before its task, except task 27's (brief 100 §Seams "Phase 18" already names both files; recorded GREEN at L1) and
task 15's `skills/bb-course-pull/SKILL.md` `waitForEvent` line (0 today).
"`<file>` PASS" means `node scripts/db-test.mjs --only <file>` prints `PASS  <file>` and exits 0 (Phase 15's runner,
brief 95 §"RPC signatures, functions, the role, and the runner's command contract"). Every new `db/tests/phase18_*.sql`
file starts `begin;`, ends `rollback;`, and on success returns one row whose first column ends in `: PASS` (that
section's pass rule; §Seams "Phase 15 → 18"). "Post-embed (x) PASS" means the
`phase18_post_embed_checks.sql` line reads PASS, or its FAIL message names no `(x)` (task 1 raises once with every
failed assertion in one line).

| # | task | covers | owner | deterministic check | demo line for Stack |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **RED baseline**, written before any fix: `db/tests/phase18_post_embed_checks.sql`, every assertion scoped to current files (`superseded_by is null`, P-89), asserts (a) every current file with `text_status <> 'na'` has ≥ 1 `bb_file_text` row; (b) every current `na` file shares `sha256` with a current `extracted` file (17 ↔ 15), or its id is in the test's own named-exception list, which is empty; (c) for every unit of a current file and model `gte-small`: `part_no` runs `1..n` with no missing number, part 1 starts at 0, the last part ends at `char_length(text)`, and each part starts at or before the previous part's end (parts **overlap** by design, embed-corpus `PART_OVERLAP = 200`; 761 of 1,545 do today, so "start = previous end" would be wrong); anti-join WHERE on the join key only; (d) hybrid `supplicant` on units 750 and 738, `subrequirements` on 482, keyword `supplicant` on 738 and 750, and the lowest-`text_id` multi-part `[notes]` unit, each come back labelled under Contract rule 121. The SQL runner cannot embed text, so hybrid calls pass the unit's own stored part-1 embedding as `query_embedding`; the label rule must hold whichever part the tiebreak picks. The runner prints only the first line of a unit's error and a unit stops at its first raise, so the file runs every assertion, collects each failure, and raises **once** with a one-line message naming each failed letter and its ids (brief 95 task 14's `format('FAIL …')` shape), e.g. `FAIL (b) na without twin: 68; (d) unlabelled notes: supplicant/750, supplicant/738, …`. When nothing failed it raises nothing and returns one row, `phase18_post_embed_checks: PASS`, as the runner's pass rule requires | P-24, P-89, R-61, R-62, S2-rag-1 | W-48 | `node scripts/db-test.mjs --only phase18_post_embed_checks.sql` before task 7 → the `phase18_post_embed_checks.sql` line reads FAIL, and its message names file 68 under `(b)` and `supplicant` under `(d)`, exit 1; after tasks 7 and 20 → `PASS  phase18_post_embed_checks.sql`, exit 0 | "This check fails today on the leak you'd see in ⌘K; by the end it passes." |
| 2 | `ingest/fetch_signed.mjs` + test (Contract §Scripts) | P-22, P-36, R-60 | W-49 | `node --test ingest/fetch_signed.test.mjs` → 0 failures; the cases cover 2-hop and 3-hop chains accepted, a final host outside `.content.blackboardcdn.com` refused, a 4th hop refused, 401/403 → `session_expired`, 404 → `gone`, and `EXDEV` → copy-then-unlink | "Downloads no longer depend on the browser's download event." |
| 3 | `ingest/embed_corpus.mjs` + test | P-23, P-92, P-82, S2-rag-1 | W-49 | `node --test ingest/embed_corpus.test.mjs` → 0 failures (loops to `remaining_parts` 0; 546/503 retried within budget; non-empty `failed` → exit 1; `--check` sends `dry_run: true`; `sb_publishable_` refused); live `node ingest/embed_corpus.mjs --check` → `missing_parts_before=0`, exit 0 | "Embedding is one command, and the pull runs it for you." |
| 4 | `pull_files.mjs`: `--fetch`, `--restale`, the embed step, `--no-embed`; header without the download-event snippet | P-22, P-23, R-60 | W-49 | `node --test ingest/pull_files.test.mjs` → 0 failures, with the 17 existing tests kept and new cases for `--fetch` (hop validation), `--restale` (one transaction per row, new key) and the embed call (once after ≥ 1 unit; never on `--dry-run` / `--no-embed`); `grep -cF "waitForEvent('download'" ingest/pull_files.mjs` → 0 (today 1: the header's `page.waitForEvent('download', { timeout: 60000 })`, which the old pattern with a closing paren never matched) | "Same script; it now fetches the bytes itself." |
| 5 | Crawler **v5 probe**: `CRAWLER_VERSION = 5`; `crawler.probe` (announcement keys, id-shaped values, `misses` per key list); `creatorUserId` added to `AUTHOR_KEYS`; a bare id kept as `authorUserId`; `feedbackToUser` first for attempt feedback | R-70, R-66, P-97 | W-50 | `cd web && npx vitest run test/crawler.announcements.test.ts test/crawler.attempts.test.ts test/fixtures.phase12b.test.ts` → 0 failures (a bare `_123_1` creator → `author: null, authorUserId: '_123_1'`; `feedbackToUser: {rawText}` → its text; an unknown shape → `misses` + 1); `grep -c "const CRAWLER_VERSION = 5;" ingest/bb_crawler.js` → 1 | "The next sync records what Blackboard really sends instead of dropping it." |
| 6 | Migration 120 (P-26) + its test: the two chains, file 151's bucket and IST.323's `syllabus_path` (Contract §Tables, row 120) | P-26, R-63 | W-48 | `phase18_120_supersede_file_chains.sql` PASS (it asserts the two `superseded_by` values, 151's bucket and IST.323's `syllabus_path` exactly as the SQL below reads them); `select id, superseded_by from bb_files where id in (2,74) order by id` → `(2,151)`, `(74,149)`; `select bucket from bb_files where id = 151` → `syllabus_policy` (`unclassified` on 2026-09-27); `select classified_by = 'agent' and classification_confidence = (select classification_confidence from bb_files where id = 2) from bb_files where id = 151` → true; `select syllabus_path from courses where id = 'IST.323'` → `IST.323/323Fall26V1.4.docx` (`IST.323/323Fall26V1.3.1.docx` on 2026-09-27); `select count(*) from search_file_text('syllabus','IST.323',50,false) where file_id = 2` → 0 | "IST.323 shows one syllabus: V1.4." |
| 7 | Migration 121: notes rule in both search functions (+ `part_fts` only if task 8 says so) + `phase18_121_search_contract.sql` | R-62, R-77 | W-48 | `phase18_121_search_contract.sql` PASS: `pg_get_function_arguments` and `pg_get_function_result` of both functions equal the literals the test file holds, copied from prod before 121 (Postgres prints the defaults with casts, e.g. `p_model text DEFAULT 'gte-small'::text`, so the §RPC signatures prose is not the literal), `prosecdef` is false, `proconfig` equals Phase 15's pin and `proacl::text` equals the value recorded in `98c` before 121; post-embed (d) PASS | "⌘K never passes a professor's speaker notes off as slide text." |
| 8 | R-77 re-measure: W10 B3's probe, `EXPLAIN (ANALYZE, BUFFERS)`, warm, limit 12, "final exam date" and "attendance policy", 5 runs each, before 121 and after | R-77 | W-48 | `98c` §R-77 holds the lines `before_final_median_ms=<n>`, `before_attendance_median_ms=<n>`, `after_final_median_ms=<n>`, `after_attendance_median_ms=<n>` and either `part_fts=built` or `part_fts=not_built`: `grep -c "_median_ms=" docs/planning/sprint-2/verification/98c_W48_VERIFICATION.md` → 4, `grep -c "^part_fts=" docs/planning/sprint-2/verification/98c_W48_VERIFICATION.md` → 1; each after-median ≤ 1.25 × its before-median; `part_fts=built` exactly when a before-median ≥ 50 ms (PM's line, open item 5). The DECISIONS row is the PM's, counted in task 29 (workers never touch `project-state/`) | "Search is still fast; here are the numbers." |
| 9 | Migration 122 + `phase18_122_supersede_rule.sql` | R-63 | W-48 | `phase18_122_supersede_rule.sql` PASS, its assertions: with 2 and 74 un-superseded inside the transaction, the function over the newest registered crawl writes exactly 2 rows (2→151, 74→149); a replay writes 0; 31/32/47 and 155/156 unchanged; `stack` rows unchanged; an older run writes 0; a name-only match raises exactly 1 attention row and writes 0 | "A re-uploaded file replaces the old copy on the next sync by itself." |
| 10 | Migration 123 + `phase18_123_file_sessions.sql` | R-67 | W-48 | `phase18_123_file_sessions.sql` PASS, its assertions: after `link_file_sessions(null)`, 0 current course files have `week_no` null where `file_week_no(course_id, path, file_name)` is not null; 0 pre-existing `week_no` / `session_id` values changed; 0 `storage_path` / `local_path` changed; every unlinked file with ≥ 2 candidate sessions has exactly 1 open attention row; replay writes 0. Prod: `select count(*) from bb_files where (id, session_id) in ((31,129),(47,130),(32,131))` → 3 | "A session row shows the files for that class." |
| 11 | Migration 124 + `phase18_124_stage_files_replay.sql` | R-63, R-67 | W-48 | `phase18_124_stage_files_replay.sql` PASS, its assertions: a replay of the newest registered crawl changes 0 `bb_files` rows; `counts` has keys `superseded_auto` and `session_links`; identity args = `p_run_id uuid, p_sync_run_id bigint`; `select md5(prosrc) from pg_proc where proname = 'stage_content'` equals the value recorded in `98c` before 124 | "Every sync now does both on its own." |
| 12 | Migration 125 + `phase18_125_geo103_reading_routes.sql` | R-68 | W-48 | `phase18_125_geo103_reading_routes.sql` PASS; `select count(*) from readings where id in (39,41,44,49,52,58,59,60,61,62) and on_blackboard` → 0; `select (select url from readings where id = 45) = (select url from bb_content where id = 114)` → true | "GEO chapters say Off-platform; the phys.org article opens." |
| 13 | Migration 126 + `phase18_126_assignment_bb_url.sql` | R-69 | W-48 | `phase18_126_assignment_bb_url.sql` PASS (a synthetic new column with `contentId` inserts with `bb_item_id` and `bb_url` set; a confirmed `bb_url` is never overwritten; replay writes 0); `select count(*) from assignments where bb_url like 'https://blackboard.syracuse.edu/ultra/courses/%/outline/assessment/test/%gradeitemView=details'` → 37 (38 if 98a §2 confirms the survey segment) | "Every Blackboard test links to its own page." |
| 14 | Migration 127, with no `db/tests` file: `db_test_runner` has no usage on schema `cron` (prod `pg_namespace.nspacl` for `cron` = `{supabase_admin=UC/supabase_admin,postgres=U*/supabase_admin}`; brief 95 freezes the role with nothing on `cron`), so every read below runs through `execute_sql` | R-72 | W-48 | `execute_sql`: `select count(*) from cron.job where jobname = 'bb2dash-ical-poll'` → 0 (1 today); `select count(*) from cron.job where jobname in ('bb2dash-transform-tick','bb2dash-calendar-push')` → 2; `select count(*) from sync_runs where source = 'ical'` 48 h after apply equals the value recorded in `98c` at apply | "The daily 'ok' row with no data behind it is gone." |
| 15 | bb-sync step 4b becomes "Pull the files", for course and submission rows. The browser half walks hops with `page.context().request.get(u, { maxRedirects: 0 })`; the script half runs `pull_files.mjs --fetch` for course rows, then `--bucket my_submissions`, then `--restale`, then `embed_corpus.mjs --check`. Step 5's `result` gains `files_pulled` and `files_not_pulled`; step 6 names every row not pulled; the "Course file bytes are not downloaded here" rule goes. `CADENCE_RUNBOOK.md` step 4 and `skills/bb-course-pull/SKILL.md` follow | R-60, P-22, B-37 | W-49 | `grep -cF "waitForEvent('download'"` → 0 in each of `skills/bb-sync/SKILL.md` (today 1, :155), `ingest/CADENCE_RUNBOOK.md` (today 1, :64) and `skills/bb-course-pull/SKILL.md` (today 0); `grep -cF "bb.downloadAll" skills/bb-course-pull/SKILL.md` → 0 (today 1, :35); `grep -cF "file bytes are not downloaded here" skills/bb-sync/SKILL.md` → 0 (today 1, the Rules bullet); `grep -cF "pull_files.mjs --fetch" skills/bb-sync/SKILL.md` → ≥ 1; `grep -cF "embed_corpus.mjs --check" skills/bb-sync/SKILL.md` → ≥ 1 | "The sync pulls every new file before it reports." |
| 16 | **Sync gate and probe sitting** (after tasks 2–5 and 15 are on the phase branch). Before the gate the PM copies `skills/bb-sync/SKILL.md` from `feat/ingest-corpus-18` over `C:/Users/stack/.claude/skills/bb-sync/SKILL.md`: `/bb-sync` loads that installed copy (a plain directory, byte-identical to `main` a5042fa's file on 2026-09-24), not the worktree's, so without the copy the gate would run the old step 4b and task 17 would read `files_not_pulled` as null. The copy is taken from the branch blob, in Git Bash (PowerShell 5.1's `>` writes UTF-16), from `bb2dash-wt-18`: `git show feat/ingest-corpus-18:skills/bb-sync/SKILL.md > C:/Users/stack/.claude/skills/bb-sync/SKILL.md`. The blob is LF while the checkout is CRLF (`core.autocrlf=true`), so a plain `cmp` of checkout against copy would false-fail; the check ignores CR at line ends. If the PR does not merge, the PM restores `main`'s copy the same way: `git show main:skills/bb-sync/SKILL.md > C:/Users/stack/.claude/skills/bb-sync/SKILL.md`. Stack files the request with the web app's Sync button in a browser tab (it inserts the `agent_requests` row and copies the command; the desktop shell acts only on a POST from its own window, `desktop/src/main/sync-terminal.ts:4–7`). The sync is run by hand from the phase worktree, never from the desktop Sync button: that button itself runs `claude '/bb-sync <id>'` in Windows Terminal at `config.repoDir`, the main checkout on `main` (`desktop/src/core/config.ts:27`, `desktop/src/core/sync-command.ts:56` and `:84–85`, `desktop/src/main/sync-terminal.ts:194`), where the skill's repo-relative `ingest/bb_crawler.js`, `ingest/pull_files.mjs --fetch` and `ingest/embed_corpus.mjs` would be `main`'s v4 crawler and old scripts. The desktop route is proven only after merge, once `main` carries this phase's skill and scripts. Stack opens the terminal with `wt -d C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-18` and runs `claude "/bb-sync <request>"` in it. After the sync reports, the PM copies the files it mirrored: the pull ran in `bb2dash-wt-18`, so `pull_files.mjs` wrote every pulled course and submission file under `bb2dash-wt-18/course context/` (its default `--mirror` is `path.join(ingestDir, '..', 'course context')`, `ingest/pull_files.mjs:250`), while each row's `local_path` names the repo-relative `course context/<relpath>` (`:175`) that the main checkout's gitignored folder holds; without the copy that folder misses them, and they are lost when the worktree is removed. In PowerShell the PM counts them, `(Get-ChildItem -LiteralPath 'C:\Users\stack\projects\bb2dash-wt-18\course context' -Recurse -File).Count`, writes the number into `98a` as `mirror_files=<n>` (0, with nothing to copy, if the folder does not exist), then copies with `robocopy "C:\Users\stack\projects\bb2dash-wt-18\course context" "C:\Users\stack\projects\bb2dash\course context" /E` (never `/MIR` or `/PURGE`: the main folder holds every earlier file). In the same tab the PM records `98a_PROBE_SITTING.md`, with captured bodies scrubbed as 80f did: `## §1` raw announcement shape and creator ids · `## §2` one per-item Ultra URL from Blackboard's own UI (a survey too, if one exists) · `## §3` whether any student view returns meeting times · `## §4` the `feedbackToUser` shape on IST.352 column `_3610995_1` · `## §5` whether an IST.352 group attempt lists files | P-27, B-40, R-60, R-66, R-69, R-70, R-73 | PM + Stack | before the sync, in Git Bash from `bb2dash-wt-18`: `git diff --no-index --ignore-cr-at-eol --quiet skills/bb-sync/SKILL.md C:/Users/stack/.claude/skills/bb-sync/SKILL.md` → no stdout, exit 0 (git may print "LF will be replaced by CRLF" on stderr for the LF copy; that warning is not the check); if the PR does not merge, after the restore, from the main checkout: `git diff --no-index --ignore-cr-at-eol --quiet C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash/skills/bb-sync/SKILL.md C:/Users/stack/.claude/skills/bb-sync/SKILL.md` → no stdout, exit 0; pre-gate, in the sync terminal before `claude`: `(Get-Location).Path` (PowerShell) → `C:\Users\stack\projects\bb2dash-wt-18`, or `pwd` (Git Bash) → `/c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-18`; the gate: `select count(*) from bb_raw where run_id = '<run>' and kind = 'course' and (payload->'crawler'->>'version')::int = 5` → 7; `select state from agent_requests where id = <request>` → `done`; `grep -c '^## §' docs/planning/sprint-2/evidence/98a_PROBE_SITTING.md` → 5; the mirror copy, after it, in PowerShell: `robocopy "C:\Users\stack\projects\bb2dash-wt-18\course context" "C:\Users\stack\projects\bb2dash\course context" /E /L /NJH /NDL /NFL` → its `Files :` summary row reads `Total` = `mirror_files`, `Copied` 0 and `FAILED` 0 (`/L` only lists; `Extras` counts the main folder's other files and is not the check); if the worktree's `course context/` does not exist, `98a` records `mirror_files=0` and `mirror_copy=skipped` and no robocopy runs (the same for `mirror_files_run2` at L7) | "One sync and one sitting settle five questions." |

## Workers

Workers commit and push per task (`feat(18-<n>): …`), never touch `project-state/`, and write their evidence to their
verification note. W-48 applies migrations under the file's name after a begin…rollback dry run. The PM integrates and
resolves the shared-file rebase with Phase 17.

PM session: tasks 16, 17, 20, 26 (DECISIONS branch), 27–29; `98a`; `walks/walk-18/` with `98w`; the mirror copy into
the main checkout's gitignored `course context/` after each sync (task 16, L7); the `search` redeploy at merge.
Order: 1 → (2, 3, 5, 6, 8-before) → 4 → 7 → 8-after → (9, 10) → 11 → (12–14 then **128**, 23–25) → 15 →
**16 (gate)** → 17–22, with the **second sync** (L7) once task 18 is on the phase branch → 26–29. 128 is applied right after 126 and 127, and before
the GREEN runs of tasks 9, 10 and 13: those tasks apply 122, 123 and 126 after their RED runs, and their GREEN runs
wait for 128. The second sync precedes task 28 and is skipped on B-36's fallback. Task 8's "before" medians are taken
before 121 is applied, and they decide whether 121 builds `part_fts` (`part_fts=built` exactly when a before-median is
≥ 50 ms); its "after" medians are taken right after task 7 applies 121, before 122.

## Out of scope

* `stage_content`, `bb_content`'s unique key, `contentHandler` carry, rename ghosts, per-crawl content history, the
  transform driver and register-first, Classwork descriptions (R-64, R-65, R-71, R-76, P-25, P-94, P-95, P-98): **Phase 19**.
* `stage_gaps` and gap self-closing (R-56), Activity wording for new counts (R-58, P-72), the Stream and content-tree
  views, the staging proof (R-47): **Phase 17**.
* The container runner, its image, a scheduled sync (R-81–R-96): **Phase 14**. V-1 grading rows: **Phase 16**. The
  harness store: **Phase 20**. Any styling: **Phase 22**.
* Showing attempt feedback on a screen; any UI for corpus coverage (B-8): not scheduled this sprint.
* A pg_cron embed drain; turning `verify_jwt` off on `embed-corpus`; changing, redeploying or re-chunking `embed-corpus`;
  a model change.
* `.doc` / OCR automation in `extract_text.py`; re-OCR of file 69 (see open items).

## Open items for Stack

Items the B-numbers leave open, each with the default this brief builds:

1. **File 62** (IST.352 instructor bio): gone from Blackboard with no successor (R-63 (4)). Not in 93 §5, so this is a
   new question. Default (PROVISIONAL): it stays current with its missing note; no supersession.
2. **`.doc` / OCR automation** (R-61 (5)). Default: not automated. A future `na` file fails check (b) and is converted
   by hand, as 68 is.
3. **File 69** (noisy pypdf text, R-61 (2)). Default: not re-OCR'd this phase.
4. **Parts over 512 tokens**, if task 21 finds any. Default: report the count and the five longest; a chunker change
   would re-embed the corpus and is a later call. If B-42 is answered "no credential" (PROVISIONAL, B-42), task 21's
   live run has no DSN and this item reports it as not run, with no count.
5. **PM thresholds**: R-77's build line (a before-median ≥ 50 ms), the eval bar (hybrid MRR ≥ 0.900), and
   `link_confidence` 1.0 / 0.8. Say if any should differ.
6. **Per-course week rules** as drafted in the Contract (GEO `Week N`, IST.323 `Lecture #N - Week N`, IST.352 `WKnn`,
   none elsewhere): confirm with B-35.
7. **The one survey-linked assignment**: keeps the course-level link until 98a §2 shows its Ultra segment.
8. **Q10's golden truth** loses file 2 with migration 120. Default (PROVISIONAL): the truth becomes 151 (V1.4), whose
   text carries the same answer; file 13 drops out of Q10's truth unless its text carries the answer phrase.
