# 100 · W-56 verification — images, MCP (tasks 17 and 14)

Worker W-56, Phase 14 (brief `docs/planning/sprint-2/briefs/100_PHASE14_containers.md`), cut early for
tasks 14 and 17 only. Branch `feat/containers-14-images` in bb2dash, worktree
`C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-containers-14-images`, cut from `feat/containers-14` at ae23663.
Machine: stack-laptop, Windows 11, Docker Desktop (Docker 29.8.1), Node v24.19.0, npm 11.17.0.

No real secret was created, read, copied or printed. Every key file below is a dummy written into the
session scratchpad (`sb_secret_DUMMY_not_a_real_key`, with a BOM and CRLF). `C:/Users/stack/.claude.json`,
`C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash/.env` and `C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets/` were not touched (the last
was only listed by name, to read `set-secret.ps1`'s usage).

## Task 17 — the materials MCP image, the key from a file, the registration recipe, smoke `--docker`

### RED (tests written first, before `src/env-file.ts` existed or `config.ts` read a file)

```
cd mcp-server && npx vitest run test/env-file.test.ts
  FAIL  test/env-file.test.ts [ test/env-file.test.ts ]
  Error: Cannot find module '../src/env-file.js' imported from …/mcp-server/test/env-file.test.ts
  Test Files  1 failed (1)      Tests  no tests

cd mcp-server && npx vitest run test/config.test.ts
  × reads the key from the file the variable names, BOM and CRLF stripped
  × the file wins over SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE and the legacy SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY
  × a named file that is missing fails, never falling back to the plain variable
  × a named file that is empty fails, never falling back to the plain variable
  × with neither set, the error names the file variable as the way in
  Test Files  1 failed (1)      Tests  5 failed | 16 passed (21)
```

Baseline before any change: `npx vitest run` → `Test Files 5 passed (5)`, `Tests 88 passed (88)`.

### GREEN

```
cd mcp-server && npx vitest run test/env-file.test.ts test/config.test.ts
  Test Files  2 passed (2)      Tests  33 passed (33)                       -> 0 failures
grep -rn "console.log" mcp-server/src | wc -l                               -> 0
cd mcp-server && npm test            -> Test Files 6 passed (6), Tests 106 passed (106)
cd mcp-server && npm run typecheck   -> exit 0
cd mcp-server && npm run build       -> exit 0
cd mcp-server && npm run test:coverage -> Statements 95.25%, Branches 85.3%, Functions 100%, Lines 95.77%
grep -rn 'C:/\|C:\\' mcp-server/src | wc -l                                 -> 0   (for task 16's grep-clean)
```

The rule as built (`src/env-file.ts`, `src/config.ts` `resolveKey`): a non-blank
`SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_FILE` is the only source of the key. It wins over `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE` and the
legacy `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY`, and a missing, unreadable (a folder: `EISDIR`), empty or multi-line file
stops the server with a `ConfigError` naming the variable and the path, never falling back to the plain
variable and never printing the file's content. A leading UTF-8 BOM and surrounding CR, LF and spaces are
stripped. A blank `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_FILE` counts as unset, so today's host registration (key in the
env block) keeps working until the cut-over. Only this one `*_FILE` variable is read; no other variable
gains a file form.

### The image (`mcp-server/Dockerfile`, `mcp-server/.dockerignore`)

```
docker pull node:22-slim        -> Digest: sha256:43ac6c60b8f89723f746e8a92ce91abd5017e627ce1ddfe4238355d3a30b772c
docker build -t bb2dash-mcp:local mcp-server           -> exit 0 (build context 144 kB: the allow-list)
docker run --rm --entrypoint id bb2dash-mcp:local      -> uid=1000(node) gid=1000(node) groups=1000(node)
docker inspect bb2dash-mcp:local --format "{{.Config.User}} {{json .Config.Env}} {{json .Config.ExposedPorts}}"
  -> node ["PATH=…","NODE_VERSION=22.23.3","YARN_VERSION=1.22.22","NODE_ENV=production"] null
docker run --rm --entrypoint sh bb2dash-mcp:local -c 'ls /app; test -d /app/src && echo HAS_SRC || echo no-src'
  -> dist node_modules package.json / no-src
docker history --no-trunc bb2dash-mcp:local --format "{{.CreatedBy}}" | grep -c "sb_secret_"   -> 0
docker images bb2dash-mcp:local --format "{{.Size}}"   -> 359MB
```

Multi-stage on `node:22-slim`: `npm ci` and `npm run build` in the build stage, `npm prune --omit=dev`,
then only `package.json`, the production `node_modules` and `dist/` copied into the runtime stage, run as
`node`. No `EXPOSE`, no port: stdio only. The `.dockerignore` is an allow-list (`package.json`,
`package-lock.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/`), so no `.env`, key, test or script reaches the context.

### Smoke of the image over stdio, dummy key (startup and tool listing)

```
node mcp-server/scripts/smoke.mjs --docker --key-file <scratchpad>/dummy-secrets/bb2dash_mcp_service_key --tools-only
  smoke: docker bb2dash-mcp:local (tools only)
    [server] [bb2dash-materials] v0.1.0 ready — bb2dash search Edge Function + PostgREST at https://goultdzqcavefcgnifdy.supabase.co; floor 0.78
  PASS  three tools advertised  — get_material_text, list_courses, search_materials
  smoke: all checks passed                                         -> exit 0
node mcp-server/scripts/smoke.mjs --docker        (no --key-file, no SECRETS_DIR)
  smoke: --docker needs --key-file <path>, or SECRETS_DIR set.     -> exit 2
docker ps -a --filter ancestor=bb2dash-mcp:local | wc -l (after)   -> 0 containers left (--rm)
```

The dummy key file was written with a BOM and CRLF, so the start also proves the strip inside the image.
A real search needs the real key: that is Stack's step below.

Failure paths in the image (Git Bash, `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`):

```
missing file   -> [bb2dash-materials] fatal startup error
                  Config error: SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_FILE names /run/secrets/bb2dash_mcp_service_key, which does not exist.   exit 1
empty file     -> Config error: SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_FILE names /run/secrets/bb2dash_mcp_service_key, which is empty.         exit 1
stdin at EOF   -> "… ready …" then exit 0 in 0.75 s (the container ends when its client closes stdin)
```

The registration's arguments, run from PowerShell 5.1 exactly as the README writes them (the `--mount`
value quoted for its commas), with the dummy key: `ready`, exit 0.

**Found on the way: Docker Desktop on Windows creates a missing bind source as an empty folder, even with
`--mount`** (on Linux `--mount` refuses instead). A run with `source=<scratchpad>/absent_key` left a folder
`absent_key` behind (removed). So the key file must be written before the registration first runs; the
README says so, the smoke refuses a missing `--key-file`, and the server's `EISDIR` message says to delete
the folder. If this happens in `SECRETS_DIR`, `set-secret.ps1` cannot write the file until the folder is
removed.

### compose.yaml: `bb2dash-mcp`, profile `mcp`, image only

```
SECRETS_DIR=<scratchpad>/dummy-secrets docker compose -p bb2dash-images-test --profile mcp config --services
  -> bb2dash-mcp, sync
SECRETS_DIR=<scratchpad>/dummy-secrets docker compose -p bb2dash-images-test --profile mcp run --rm -T bb2dash-mcp < /dev/null
  -> [bb2dash-materials] v0.1.0 ready — … floor 0.78        exit 0
docker compose -p bb2dash-images-test --profile mcp down -> network bb2dash-images-test_default removed;
  no container, volume or network of that project remains
```

The umbrella's include still resolves with this file (bb2dash-stack worktree, read-only `config`):

```
BB2DASH_DIR=C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-containers-14-images SECRETS_DIR=<dummy> \
  docker compose --profile mcp --profile dev config --services   -> bb2dash-mcp, dev, harness-jobs, sync (4)
```

Both files declare the secret `bb2dash_mcp_service_key` with the same `${SECRETS_DIR:-./secrets}/…` file,
as they already do `novnc_password`; compose accepts the identical definitions. The `sync` service is
byte-for-byte unchanged; the file's header comment now names the new service.

One call against the Local surfaces table: its rule "`restart: unless-stopped` (not `dev`)" is not applied
to `bb2dash-mcp`. A stdio server exits when its client closes stdin, so a restart policy would only loop
it; the service has no restart policy and no healthcheck, and the profile keeps `up` from starting it.

### Owed to Stack (task 17's Stack step), in this order, PowerShell

The brief's `bb2dash-stack/secrets/bb2dash_mcp_service_key` reads `C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets/` since
the 2026-10-03 DECISIONS row (`SECRETS_DIR`).

```powershell
# 0. Only if `docker images bb2dash-mcp:local` shows nothing (it was built from this branch on 2026-10-03):
docker build -t bb2dash-mcp:local C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-containers-14-images/mcp-server

# 1. The key into SECRETS_DIR, at the hidden prompt (the sb_secret_ value bb2dash/.env holds today).
#    Do this before step 3: Docker Desktop makes a folder of a missing bind source.
& C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets/set-secret.ps1 bb2dash_mcp_service_key
#    -> stored bb2dash_mcp_service_key (<n> bytes)

# 2. A live smoke of the image with the real key (all three tools against the corpus).
node C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-containers-14-images/mcp-server/scripts/smoke.mjs --docker --key-file C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets/bb2dash_mcp_service_key
#    -> last line: smoke: all checks passed   (exit 0)

# 3. Re-register the server on the image; the old entry (key inline) goes with the remove.
claude mcp remove bb2dash -s user
claude mcp add --scope user bb2dash -- docker run -i --rm --mount "type=bind,source=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets/bb2dash_mcp_service_key,target=/run/secrets/bb2dash_mcp_service_key,readonly" -e SUPABASE_URL=https://goultdzqcavefcgnifdy.supabase.co -e SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_FILE=/run/secrets/bb2dash_mcp_service_key bb2dash-mcp:local

# 4. Take the key out of bb2dash/.env: delete every line this lists (names only, never the value).
Select-String -Path C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash/.env -Pattern '^([A-Z_]+)=.*sb_secret_' | ForEach-Object { "line $($_.LineNumber): $($_.Matches[0].Groups[1].Value)" }
#    then edit C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash/.env and remove those lines.

# 5. The checks (Git Bash), then restart Claude Code so sessions pick up the docker registration.
grep -c "sb_secret_" C:/Users/stack/.claude.json                 # -> 0
grep -c "sb_secret_" C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash/.env        # -> 0
claude mcp list | grep -c "^bb2dash: .*Connected"                # -> 1
```

If the `.claude.json` count is not 0 after step 3, a local-scope copy of the old entry remains: run
`claude mcp remove bb2dash -s local` from `C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash` and count again.
`scripts/google-consent.mjs` stays a host run; for its one command it takes the key from the file:
`$env:BB2DASH_SERVICE_KEY = [IO.File]::ReadAllText('C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets/bb2dash_mcp_service_key'); node scripts/google-consent.mjs; Remove-Item Env:BB2DASH_SERVICE_KEY`
(plus its three Google variables, as its header says).

### Not verified here (task 17)

* A real search through the image (needs the real key: step 2 above).
* `claude mcp add` itself, and `claude mcp list` against the docker registration (writes
  `~/.claude.json`: Stack's step 3). The arguments were proven by `docker run` from PowerShell and by
  the smoke, which spawns the same argument list.
* Reading a key file from `C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets/` itself, whose access list holds only Stack's
  account: the dummy lived in the scratchpad. Docker Desktop reads bind sources as the signed-in user, so
  it should read it; step 2 proves it.

## Task 14, host half — the locked Python set; `extractUnits` runs it; Xpdf vs poppler on the fixtures

Not on the integrated branch of task 13a: W-55's `feat/containers-14-sync` is not merged into this
branch yet, and the task 14 files do not touch W-55's. The check below is re-run after the 13a merge.

### RED (test first; fixtures made, `extractUnits` not yet changed)

```
node --test --test-reporter=tap ingest/extract_text.test.mjs     (before ingest/pyproject.toml existed)
  # SyntaxError: The requested module './pull_files.mjs' does not provide an export named 'extractUnits'
  not ok 1 - ingest\extract_text.test.mjs
  # tests 1   # pass 0   # fail 1
```

The same RED after `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`, the four fixtures and `expected.json` were written: the
file still failed on the missing export, i.e. `extractUnits` still ran `uv run --python 3.12 --with …`.

### GREEN

```
node --test --test-reporter=tap ingest/extract_text.test.mjs
  ok 1 - pyproject.toml pins the three libraries exactly, and uv.lock locks the same versions
  ok 2 - extractUnits runs the locked project, never `--with`
  ok 3 - sample.pdf: the locked extractor's units equal expected.json
  ok 4 - sample.docx: the locked extractor's units equal expected.json
  ok 5 - sample.pptx: the locked extractor's units equal expected.json
  ok 6 - sample.xlsx: the locked extractor's units equal expected.json
  # tests 6   # pass 6   # fail 0

node --test --test-reporter=tap ingest/extract_text.test.mjs ingest/pull_files.test.mjs   (the task's check, host)
  # tests 43
  # pass 43
  # fail 0
```

Node 24's default reporter prints `ℹ fail 0` for the same run; `--test-reporter=tap` gives the brief's
`# fail 0` line.

* `ingest/pyproject.toml`: `requires-python = ">=3.12,<3.13"` (the `--python 3.12` the old call passed),
  `python-docx==1.2.0`, `python-pptx==1.0.2`, `openpyxl==3.1.5` (what `extract_text.py` imports beyond
  the standard library), `[tool.uv] package = false`.
* `ingest/uv.lock` (uv 0.12.19, `uv lock --check` clean): 9 packages — the project, the three above, and
  `lxml` 6.1.3, `pillow` 12.3.0, `xlsxwriter` 3.2.9, `et-xmlfile` 2.0.0, `typing-extensions` 4.16.0, with
  manylinux wheels for the image as well as Windows ones.
* `extractUnits` (`ingest/pull_files.mjs`, now exported, :427 on this branch; the brief's ":187" predates
  Phase 18) runs `uv run --locked --project <ingest> python <ingest>/extract_text.py <file>`; `--locked`
  stops on a stale lock instead of re-resolving. Its `run` argument defaults to `execFileSync` and is
  injected only by the test. Nothing else in the file changed, so the constant `EXTRACT_DEPS` (:93) is now
  unused; it is left for the PM to delete at integration, under the "that function only" rule.
* `uv run` creates `ingest/.venv` on first use; uv writes a `.gitignore` of `*` inside it, so
  `git status` stays clean.
* The fixtures (`ingest/fixtures/extract/`) are made by `make_samples.py` there, every word written in
  that script, no course material: `sample.pdf` (3 pages, page 2 blank, a hand-written PDF 1.4 with a
  Helvetica font), `sample.docx` (heading, paragraphs, an empty one, a 2×2 table), `sample.pptx` (title
  slide, a table slide with a speaker note, a blank slide, a text-box slide), `sample.xlsx` (a sheet with
  an empty row and a blank cell, an empty sheet, a notes sheet). `expected.json` was written by hand from
  `extract_text.py`'s rules (skipped blank units keep the numbering of what follows, ` | ` joins,
  `[notes] `) before the GREEN run, not copied from its output.
* `sample.pdf`'s binary-marker comment carries a NUL byte, so git classes it binary
  (`git ls-files --eol` → `i/-text w/-text`). The first cut had none; `git add` warned "LF will be
  replaced by CRLF", and under this laptop's `core.autocrlf=true` a later checkout would have rewritten its
  line ends and broken the xref offsets. The fixtures were regenerated and the check re-run (same
  `# fail 0`). The text files (`expected.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `uv.lock`) survive CRLF:
  `uv lock --check` on a CRLF copy of the lock → resolved, exit 0.

### pdftotext: the host is Xpdf **4.06**, not the brief's 4.00

```
which -a pdftotext            -> /ucrt64/bin/pdftotext   (C:\Program Files\Git\ucrt64\bin\pdftotext.exe)
pdftotext -v                  -> pdftotext version 4.06 [www.xpdfreader.com]
PowerShell: Get-Command pdftotext -All -> nothing (exit 1)
```

It is on Git Bash's PATH only, so `pull_files.mjs` extracts PDFs when run from Git Bash (as the bb-sync
skill does) and would report `failed: …` for every PDF from a plain PowerShell. Xpdf writes CRLF line ends
on Windows; Python's text mode turns them into LF before the JSON.

**Preview, not the owed check:** poppler in a throwaway `node:22-slim` container (Debian 12,
`pdftotext version 22.12.0`, apt-installed in a `--rm` run, the fixtures mounted read-only) gave the same
bytes for `sample.pdf` as Xpdf except LF for CRLF: the same words, the blank page's `\f\f`, the final `\f`.
The sync image's poppler (Ubuntu noble) is a different build, so the in-image run below still decides.

### Owed to task 15 (the sync image is not built here)

* The in-image half of the check: `docker compose run --rm sync node --test --test-reporter=tap
  ingest/extract_text.test.mjs` → `# fail 0`, against the same `expected.json`, recorded here with the
  image's `pdftotext -v`.
* What that run needs from the image: `uv` and `poppler-utils` installed; `ingest/pyproject.toml` and
  `ingest/uv.lock` copied and the set synced at build (`uv sync --locked --project /app/ingest`, owned by
  `pwuser`), so `extractUnits`'s `uv run --locked` needs no network at run time (`UV_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS=never`
  with noble's Python 3.12 satisfies `requires-python`); the root `.dockerignore` must exclude
  `ingest/.venv` (a Windows venv copied into a Linux image breaks `uv run`) and `__pycache__`; and the
  fixtures plus `extract_text.test.mjs`, `pull_files.mjs`, `fetch_signed.mjs` and `embed_corpus.mjs`
  present at `/app/ingest` for the test to import.
* The re-run of the host check on the integrated branch after task 13a.

## Task 17 — Stack's key move, 2026-10-03 (recorded by the PM)

Stack stored the key with `set-secret.ps1 bb2dash_mcp_service_key`, re-registered the server with the
`docker run` recipe and deleted the key's line from `bb2dash/.env`. The PM then checked, printing no value:

* `grep -c "sb_secret_" C:/Users/stack/.claude.json` → `0`
* `grep -c "sb_secret_" C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash/.env` → `0`
* the secret file: 41 bytes, `sb_secret_` shape, no newline, no BOM
* `claude mcp list` → `bb2dash: docker run -i --rm --mount type=bind,source=<the secrets folder file>,… bb2dash-mcp:local - ✔ Connected`
  (so Docker Desktop reads a file in the ACL-locked folder)
* `node mcp-server/scripts/smoke.mjs --docker --key-file C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets/bb2dash_mcp_service_key`
  → a real `search_materials` and `get_material_text` against prod, last line `smoke: all checks passed`

The service key now lives only in `C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets/bb2dash_mcp_service_key`. One host
consumer remains: `scripts/google-consent.mjs` reads `BB2DASH_SERVICE_KEY` for its one command and needs the
**legacy service-role JWT** (its line 229: the gateway rejects an `sb_secret_` Bearer), not this file's key;
it is fed from the Supabase dashboard when the calendar token is re-minted.

## Task 18 — `syncLauncher` and the login prompt (branch `feat/containers-14-launcher`)

Worktree `C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-containers-14-launcher`, cut from `origin/main` f86c818
(Phase 19 merged). Commit 9200aaf, pushed; it ships as its own early PR to `main`. Recorded here because
the launcher branch carries code only. The real desktop app was not launched and no browser tab was opened:
`electron` is mocked, and the password file read and `openExternal` are injected in every case.

Baseline on f86c818: `cd desktop && npx vitest run` → `Test Files 36 passed (36)`, `Tests 708 passed (708)`;
`npm run typecheck` → exit 0.

### RED (tests first)

```

```

`login-prompt.test.ts` holds the brief's named cases: an open item id opens the page once; a second tick
with the same id opens nothing; a new id opens again; `terminal` never opens it (no prompt is built); the URL
carries the URL-encoded password with a BOM, CR and LF stripped; a missing file opens the bare page and
logs the path (`ENOENT`), never a value. Also: no log line holds the password, its encoded form or
`password=`; a browser that will not open frees the id for the next tick; a failed read changes nothing;
a check during a check is dropped. `sync-launcher.test.ts` imports `main/index.ts` with its collaborators
mocked: `terminal` attaches the sync watcher once, `queue-only` attaches none and wraps the poller's session
reader.

What was built:

* `core/config.ts`: `syncLauncher` (`terminal` default, or `queue-only`; env `BB2DASH_SYNC_LAUNCHER`) and
  `novncPasswordFile` (env `BB2DASH_NOVNC_PASSWORD_FILE`, default `<home>\.bb2dash-secrets\novnc_password`;
  the brief's `bb2dash-stack/secrets` default is superseded by DECISIONS 2026-10-03), plus
  `usesSyncTerminal(config)`.
* `main/index.ts`: `attachSyncWatcher` only under `terminal`; under `queue-only` one log line instead.
* `core/login-prompt.ts`: `LOGIN_PAGE_URL`, `loginPageUrl(password | null)`, `newLoginItems(openIds,
  promptedIds)`, the frozen query `attention_items?select=id&ref=eq.sync-login-required&state=eq.open`, the
  password-file text rule and the row validator. No `fs`, no `electron` (C-13).
* `main/login-prompt.ts`: reads the item on each poller tick. The check rides the poller's session read
  (`withLoginPromptCheck` wraps `getSession`), so launch, interval, focus, resume and *Check now* ticks all
  look, and the poller's own files (`core/poller/*`, `poller-wiring.ts`) are unchanged. The prompted ids live
  in memory, like the sync watcher's: after an app restart an item still open opens the page once more.
  Under `BB2DASH_TEST=1` it records a `login-prompt` event (`unlocked: true|false`), never the URL.
* `core/navigation-policy.ts`: `LOGIN_PAGE_ORIGIN = 'http://127.0.0.1:6080'` and `decideLoginPageOpen`,
  which hands only that origin to `openExternal` (another port, https, `localhost`, a LAN address or the app
  are dropped). The login page is never an in-window origin. `audit.test.ts` now pins `shell.openExternal`
  to two callers: `main/navigation.ts` and `main/login-prompt.ts`.
* `desktop/README.md`: the two keys and their environment variables (one file beyond the brief's list).

Not run: the Playwright e2e suite (it launches the real app). `main/login-prompt.ts` is outside the unit
coverage `include` list in `vitest.config.mts` (not on this task's file list); its cases run regardless.

## Task 19 — repo hygiene and one source for the four repo skills

Integration first: `git merge origin/feat/containers-14` (3284858, which carries `main` f86c818 with Phase
19) into this branch → 8c86cdf, no conflict. Task 14's host check re-run on it:
`node --test --test-reporter=tap ingest/extract_text.test.mjs ingest/pull_files.test.mjs` → `# tests 43`,
`# fail 0`. Then `EXTRACT_DEPS` (`ingest/pull_files.mjs:93`, unused since task 14) was deleted → ec0cc4a,
same `# fail 0`.

### RED

```
git ls-files --eol | grep -c "i/crlf"                                   -> 1   ("fall2026 courses + context.txt")
git check-ignore local_cache/probe secrets/novnc_password | wc -l       -> 1   (secrets/ only)
node --test scripts/install-skills.test.mjs                             -> ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND …\scripts\install-skills.mjs
```

### GREEN (8dcbbc8, 8a1ce9a)

```
git ls-files --eol | grep -c "i/crlf"                                   -> 0
git check-ignore local_cache/probe secrets/novnc_password | wc -l       -> 2
node --test --test-reporter=tap scripts/install-skills.test.mjs         -> # tests 10, # pass 10, # fail 0
```

* `.gitattributes`: `* text=auto eol=lf` (with a comment). `git add --renormalize .` staged exactly one blob,
  `fall2026 courses + context.txt`; `git diff --cached --ignore-cr-at-eol` on it is empty (line ends only).
* `.gitignore`: `local_cache/` added (P-47); `secrets/` was already there, and its comment now names
  `SECRETS_DIR`.
* `scripts/install-skills.mjs` (+ test): `skills/<name>/` is the source for `bb-course-map`,
  `bb-course-pull`, `bb-sync` and `inbox-apply`. It copies every file into `--target` (default
  `<home>/.claude/skills`) and verifies each by SHA-256, the shape of the harness's
  `hooks/install-checkpoint.mjs`. `--check` writes nothing and exits 1 on a missing or differing file; a
  file the repo lacks is listed as `extra` and never deleted. One test assertion was corrected during GREEN:
  it expected `drift` 0 after a first install, where `drift` counts the files that were missing or different
  before the run (3), as the function documents; a following `--check` now asserts 0.

The DoD's web count, before and after the renormalize:

```
main checkout (f86c818):   cd web && npx vitest run -> Test Files 132 passed (132), Tests 2314 passed (2314)
this branch (8a1ce9a):     cd web && npx vitest run -> Test Files 132 passed (132), Tests 2314 passed (2314)
a fresh clone of 8a1ce9a in the session scratchpad (the LF checkout the new .gitattributes gives):
  git ls-files --eol (working tree)  -> 971 w/lf, 71 w/-text, 1 w/none, no w/crlf
  cd web && npx vitest run           -> Test Files 132 passed (132), Tests 2314 passed (2314)
  node --test ingest/extract_text.test.mjs ingest/pull_files.test.mjs scripts/install-skills.test.mjs -> # tests 53, # fail 0
  sample.pdf byte-identical to the committed one (binary, untouched by eol=lf)
```

This worktree keeps its old CRLF working files until they are next checked out; the fresh clone is the LF
view a new checkout gets.

Read-only state of the real user skills folder (nothing written):

```
node scripts/install-skills.mjs --check
  missing   bb-course-map/SKILL.md
  missing   bb-course-pull/SKILL.md
  same      bb-sync/SKILL.md
  differs   inbox-apply/SKILL.md
install-skills --check: 3 file(s) drift in C:\Users\stack\.claude\skills          (exit 1)
find C:/Users/stack/.claude/skills/synced -maxdepth 2 -type d -name "bb-course-*" | wc -l   -> 2
```

### Owed to Stack (task 19), after the phase PR is on `main`

```powershell
# 1. Install the four skills from the main checkout, then prove it (one source for the bare names).
cd C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash
node scripts/install-skills.mjs            # -> install-skills: <n> file(s) written to C:\Users\stack\.claude\skills, each verified by SHA-256
node scripts/install-skills.mjs --check    # -> install-skills --check: C:\Users\stack\.claude\skills in sync   (exit 0)

# 2. Retire the claude.ai-synced copies. First remove the bb-course-map and bb-course-pull skills where they
#    were uploaded on claude.ai, so the next sync does not bring them back; then, if the local folders remain:
Get-ChildItem C:/Users/stack/.claude/skills/synced -Directory -Recurse -Depth 1 -Filter 'bb-course-*' | Remove-Item -Recurse -Force
```

Check (Git Bash): `find C:/Users/stack/.claude/skills/synced -maxdepth 2 -type d -name "bb-course-*" | wc -l`
→ `0`. Step 1 comes first, so the bare names keep resolving to a copy while the synced ones go.

### The PM's half (task 19): already in place

`grep -c "^FASTEMBED_CACHE_DIR=" C:/Users/stack/.harness/machine.env` → `1`, value
`C:/Users/stack/.cache/fastembed` (set before this session; nothing to run).

## Task 18, round 2 (the code-review gate on 9200aaf), `feat/containers-14-launcher`

One commit per item, each test written first; the RED line is the named test failing before the fix.

| item | RED → GREEN | commit |
|---|---|---|
| 1 password in the fragment | `login-prompt.test.ts`: 2 failed → 72 passed (with navigation-policy); the URL has no `?`, `password=` only after `#`; no password → `#autoconnect=true&resize=scale` | 538beb0 |
| 3 container item only | 3 failed → 25 passed; query `select=id,ref,kind,entity&ref=eq.sync-login-required&kind=eq.stack_must_confirm&entity=eq.agent_request&state=eq.open`, and the validator drops any other ref, kind or entity; a `chrome-login-required` item never opens the page | 0b12388 |
| 2 once per New York day, persisted | 7 failed → 32 passed (+ `login-prompt-store.test.ts` 6): same day, next day, restart same day, New York date across midnight UTC (22:00Z and 02:00Z one day, 04:30Z the next); `userData/login-prompt.json`, atomic, pruned to open ids | 4abb045 |
| 4 hung `openExternal` | 1 failed → 33 passed; `OPEN_EXTERNAL_TIMEOUT_MS = 15000`, one log line, `busy` freed, nothing recorded so the next tick retries | 8062efd |
| 6 throttled read-failure log | 1 failed → 34 passed; `createErrorThrottle` (hourly): 3 failures in 45 min → 1 line, a 4th at 61 min → 2 | 98db025 |
| 7 `redact()` knows `password` | 3 failed → 18 passed; fragment, query string and JSON `"password": "…"` all `[redacted]` | 5fcda8c |
| 8 small ones | `login-prompt-branches.test.ts` would not load (`core/id-rows` missing) → 60 passed with its neighbours; one origin constant, shared `core/id-rows.ts` with `sync-terminal.ts`, `'\uFEFF'` escaped, the real default reader, the `BB2DASH_TEST=1` `recordEvent('login-prompt')` branch, a policy refusal logs and records nothing | 7970e73 |
| 5 explicit per-tick hook | 6 failed (scheduler 4, wiring 2) → 44 passed; `PollerDeps.onTick(get)` once per tick (first launch included), `afterSessionReload()` on the window's and the refresh page's `did-finish-load`; `withLoginPromptCheck` removed | cb2ea08 |
| 9 e2e | `test/e2e/login-prompt.spec.ts`: two ticks → `login-prompt` recorded once (`unlocked: true`), no `open-external`, no `sync-terminal`; `npm run test:e2e` (one run, `BB2DASH_TEST=1`) → `23 passed (12.6s)` | e6d4be9 |

After the nine: `cd desktop && npm test` → `Test Files 40 passed (40)`, `Tests 787 passed (787)`, coverage
Statements 97.03%, Branches 94.21%, Functions 97.1%, Lines 98.18%; `npm run typecheck` → exit 0;
`npm run build` → exit 0.

The same raw-BOM slip (item 8) was in this branch's MCP server: `mcp-server/src/env-file.ts` and two of its
tests held the character itself; now the `'\uFEFF'` escape, `npx vitest run` in `mcp-server` → 106 passed.

## Task 13a — the merge half (W-55's runner into this branch)

`git merge origin/feat/containers-14` (d3ead0e, which carries W-55's `feat/containers-14-sync`) →
adef2ac, no conflict, pushed. Then, after `git fetch`:

```
git rev-parse origin/feat/containers-14-sync                                       -> b0165e54b1c6598bbd08bb237d07ee3a5e7434d4
git merge-base --is-ancestor b0165e54b1c6598bbd08bb237d07ee3a5e7434d4 origin/feat/containers-14-images; echo $?   -> 0
```

## Task 15 — the sync image and compose (the spike made the runner's image), d58d2b8

What changed:

* `docker/sync/Dockerfile`: three stages on `mcr.microsoft.com/playwright:v1.63.0-noble` (and
  `ghcr.io/astral-sh/uv:0.12.19` for the `uv` binary). The build stage runs W-55's
  `cd sync && npm ci && npm run build` (esbuild; `desktop/src/core/sync-id.ts` bundled in) and prunes to
  production modules. The runtime keeps the spike's display stack (xvfb, x11vnc, novnc, websockify) and its
  entrypoint, adds `poppler-utils`, copies `sync/dist`, `sync/node_modules`, `sync/package.json` and only the
  ingest files the runner runs plus task 14's test and fixtures, and runs `uv sync --locked --project
  /app/ingest` **as pwuser** at build (`UV_PYTHON_DOWNLOADS=never`, `UV_NO_CACHE=1`; noble's Python 3.12),
  so `extractUnits`'s `uv run --locked` needs no network (`UV_OFFLINE=1` at run time). `bb-profile` and
  `/app/course context` exist in the image owned by pwuser, so fresh volumes take that owner.
  `CMD ["node", "sync/dist/main.js"]`, working directory `/app`, `USER pwuser`.
* `.dockerignore` (root, new): an allow-list (`docker/sync/`, `sync/`, `ingest/`,
  `desktop/src/core/sync-id.ts`), then `sync/node_modules`, `sync/dist`, `ingest/.venv`, `**/__pycache__`,
  `**/.env*`, `course context`, `local_cache`, `secrets` excluded.
* `compose.yaml` `sync`: build context `.` with `docker/sync/Dockerfile`, image `bb2dash-sync:local` (the
  live container's `bb2dash-sync:spike` is left alone for the PM's cut-over); the frozen names kept
  (service `sync`, `hostname: sync`, volume `bb-profile`, `127.0.0.1:6080:6080`), seccomp, `user: pwuser`,
  `init`, `shm_size: 1gb`, `restart: unless-stopped`, json-file logs. New: the three runner secrets
  (`sync_runner_db_url`, `supabase_publishable_key`, `supabase_anon_jwt`) beside `novnc_password`,
  `course-files:/app/course context`, `tmpfs: /tmp` (downloads, X's lock and socket, the heartbeat), and the
  healthcheck `node sync/dist/probe.js --heartbeat` (30 s, start period 90 s). `JITTER_MINUTES` and
  `LOGIN_WATCH_SECONDS` left the environment: they are the runner's constants (W-55).
* The spike's review fixes ride in the unchanged `entrypoint.sh` (stale X lock and socket removed,
  Chromium's `Singleton*` lock removed, the password copied without BOM, CR and LF); the runner passes
  `--hide-crash-restore-bubble` and `chromiumSandbox: true` itself (`sync/src/main.ts`).
* `docker/sync/spike/` deleted.

How it was run. Nothing touched the live `bb2dash` project, its `bb2dash_bb-profile` volume or
`harness-postgres`: everything ran as `-p bb2dash-images-test`, with a test-only override in the session
scratchpad that adds `stubdb` (a throwaway `pgvector/pgvector:0.8.6-pg17` container, TLS on, six stub
`sync_*` functions answering an always-empty queue), maps `blackboard.syracuse.edu` and
`login.microsoftonline.com` to 127.0.0.1 (no Blackboard page and no login was ever loaded) and publishes
the login page on `127.0.0.1:16080`. The four secret files were dummies in the scratchpad, deleted after.

**Task 14's in-image check (owed since task 14), in this image (poppler 24.02.0):**

```
docker compose -p bb2dash-images-test run --rm -T sync node --test --test-reporter=tap ingest/extract_text.test.mjs
  ok 1 … ok 6 (pyproject pins; extractUnits runs the locked project; sample.pdf, .docx, .pptx, .xlsx)
  # tests 6   # pass 6   # fail 0
docker run --rm --network none --entrypoint node bb2dash-sync:local --test --test-reporter=tap ingest/extract_text.test.mjs
  # tests 6   # pass 6   # fail 0          (offline: the locked set needs no network)
```

The same `expected.json` as the host's `# fail 0` under Xpdf 4.06.

**Found in W-55's runner (not changed here; `sync/` is W-55's):** every start logs one
`heartbeat write failed: ENOENT … rename '/tmp/bb2dash-sync/heartbeat.7.tmp' -> '…/heartbeat'`. Two
heartbeat writes overlap at start and share the temp name `${file}.${process.pid}.tmp` (`sync/src/main.ts`,
`writeAtomic`), so the second rename finds its temp file gone. Harmless (the next write lands and the
container is healthy within one interval); a per-write counter in the temp name would end it.

Not done here: the cut-over (`compose up` of the real `bb2dash` project on `bb2dash-sync:local`, keeping
`bb2dash_bb-profile`), which is the PM's with Stack; a real `sync_runner` DSN and a live pass (task 28).

## Task 16 — the R5 OS-bound inventory, refreshed (P-44), and grep-clean over what the images copy

The seven bb2dash offenders 91 R-86 lists at a5042fa, as they stand on this branch:

| kind | where (a5042fa → now) | what | disposition |
|---|---|---|---|
| os-bound | `desktop/src/core/config.ts:27` → :27-31 | `repoDir: 'C:\\Users\\estac\\projects\\bb2dash'`; now `win32.join(homedir(), 'projects', 'bb2dash')` | fixed before this phase (fc6602b); not copied into an image |
| os-bound | `desktop/src/core/sync-command.ts:59` → :53 | `const POWERSHELL = 'powershell.exe'`, the Windows Sync terminal's argv | not copied into an image: the sync image bundles only `desktop/src/core/sync-id.ts` (split out in task 5); it retires with the terminal launch (R-96) |
| os-bound | `scripts/validate-grading.ps1` | the PowerShell launcher for the grading validation | Phase 16 (its Node twin `scripts/validate-grading.mjs` is on `main`); not copied into an image |
| os-bound | `skills/inbox-apply/SKILL.md:31` → :30, :60 | the vault path under OneDrive; now `node C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness/hooks/resolve-config.mjs`, with `C:/Users/stack/vault` as :60's example | Phase 20 (R-97 moved the vault path to the harness resolver; the resolver's own path stays host-side); not copied into an image |
| os-bound | `skills/bb-course-pull/SKILL.md` :60-62 → :65-67 | PowerShell `Move-Item` from Downloads into the local mirror | not copied into an image (a Windows-browser skill); the runner's file step moves bytes in Node, copy-then-unlink (P-104) |
| os-bound | `skills/bb-course-map/SKILL.md` :56 | "write `course context/<course_id>/course_map.json` in the OneDrive folder" | not copied into an image; the wording is stale (v3 D-7 dropped the OneDrive mirror), left for the skill's next edit |
| os-bound | `mcp-server/scripts/smoke.mjs:33` | the `C:/Users/estac/projects/bb2dash/.env` default | fixed here (task 17, ee79822: no default; `--env-file`, or `--docker --key-file`); `scripts/` is not copied into the MCP image either |

`docker/grep-clean.test.mjs` (new). It reads every non-`--from` COPY of `docker/sync/Dockerfile` (context:
the repo root) and `mcp-server/Dockerfile` (context: `mcp-server/`), checks the contexts against
`compose.yaml`, expands each source the way the context's `.dockerignore` exclusions leave it, skips binary
files (a NUL in the first 8000 bytes: the four extract fixtures), strips comments (`//` and `/* */` in
JS/TS; `#` in Python, shell, TOML, YAML and shebang files) and greps for `C:/`, `C:\`, `.ps1`,
`powershell(.exe)` as a word, `Move-Item` and `OneDrive`. Each pattern first catches a planted line.

RED: before this task the file did not exist (`node --test docker/grep-clean.test.mjs` → `Could not find
…\docker\grep-clean.test.mjs`). The only two hits in the copied sources are comments, which the strip
removes: `sync/src/secrets.ts:10` ("files written by PowerShell carry them") and
`docker/sync/entrypoint.sh:27` ("a PowerShell redirect leaves behind").

GREEN:

```
node --test --test-reporter=tap docker/grep-clean.test.mjs
  # sync: 25 file(s) scanned of 29 copied          (4 binary fixtures skipped)
  # bb2dash-mcp: 14 file(s) scanned of 14 copied
  # tests 6
  # pass 6
  # fail 0
grep -c "^| os-bound " docs/planning/sprint-2/verification/100_W56_VERIFICATION.md   -> 7
```
