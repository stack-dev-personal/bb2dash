# 101a — V-2 verification: brief 66 walked on live data (Phase 20)

Date 2026-09-30 · PM: Phase 20, Session A · Brief: `../briefs/101_PHASE20_harness_closure.md` (task 27, P-58, R-99) ·
Walks: `../../sprint-1-hub/briefs/66_SESSION_ARCHIVAL_RAG.md` §Acceptance (A1–A6) and §Definition of done (D1–D15).
Raw record: `101a-evidence-log.md` (the PM's evidence log, kept beside this note). Every figure below comes from that log,
or from a command the PM re-ran on 2026-09-30, marked "re-run".

**SHAs.** Harness `<H>` = `9cffe90` at the start (C-H, 2026-09-29); `ea0e199` after PR-B (agentic-harness #36, merged
2026-09-30 16:37Z on Stack's word); `00539be` after harness PR #37 (`fix/backfill-former-home`, merged 2026-09-30 17:21Z).
bb2dash PR-A is #39, merged 2026-09-30 as `2904b20`. The harness main checkout was pulled `--ff-only` to `ea0e199`, then
to `00539be` (105 §3 note 2).

**C-H at `9cffe90` (2026-09-29):** eval cases `67`; migration files `N = 9`; labels figure `1`.

`<B>` = `C:/Users/stack/.claude-archive/2026-09-30/phase20-backfill`. `hm` = harness-memory (`hqkytnyiiuxovnnyixye`), read-only.

## Before and after (task 3 vs task 19)

Both taken with hm SQL on `rag.documents`, `source = 'obsidian'`, `collection = 'bb2dash'`, `type = session`.

| Count | Before (2026-09-29 17:24:20Z) | After (2026-09-30 17:48:52.710Z) |
|---|---|---|
| `hook_tags` longer than 5 | 0 | 0 |
| `repo`, `status` or `schema_version` empty | 91 | 0 |
| `phase` empty | 543 | 534 (= `phase_underivable_indexed`) |
| `branch` empty | 1 | 1 (= `branch_empty`) |
| indexed bb2dash session notes | 598 | 636 |

The task 19 report and SQL were taken back to back (105 §3 note 3): C-18 report 17:47:52Z to 17:48:52Z (`changes 0`,
`phase_underivable_indexed 534`, `branch_empty 1`, `bb2dash_notes 806`), SQL at 17:48:52.710Z.

L20-b itself: apply at `00539be` with `--relocate ca25962a/22581e0d=classes/ist466`, 804 notes written, 804 originals in
`<B>`, `<B>/backfill-apply.txt` 1699 lines; `sync-realms --push` exit 0 (projects and classes pushed, harness
up-to-date); ingest exit 0 (463 metadata-updated, 388 unchanged, 1010 chunks written). `classes/ist466` holds the 2
relocated notes; `projects` holds 0.

## Eval

`uv run ingest eval --json`, 67 cases each time.

* Before (task 3, P-61, harness commit `7dbec66`, `ingest/eval/baseline-pre-phase20.json`): hit_rate `0.9193548387096774`
  (0.9194). Re-read before L20-a (at `ea0e199`) and before L20-b (17:28Z): 0.9194.
* After (task 19): hit_rate **0.9355**. `hit_rate >= baseline` prints `true`. File `<B>/baseline-post-phase20.json`,
  not committed to the harness.

## Untagged review (task 25)

On Stack's instruction of 2026-09-30 ("I would like an agent to mark the 339 notes but not for review ... multiple ways
to verify a proposed tag"). 341 notes were `unclassified` at the time.

* Method: one evidence file per note (prompts, cwd, collection, branch, files, commands, parent tags); **two blind Opus
  taggers**, each tag needing at least two independent sources; only tags both proposed were applied. Vocabulary and
  phase-field checks were mechanical.
* Tagger A tagged 311 notes, tagger B 308; they agreed on 347 tags across 303 notes. Disagreements were dropped (A-only
  54, mostly `review`; B-only 13). 0 invalid tags.
* Applied as hand tags (`hook_tags` untouched); `unclassified` removed only where tags were added; the body's Tags row
  updated; 303 originals in `C:/Users/stack/.claude-archive/2026-09-30/phase20-tagging`.
* **Unclassified 341 → 38.** The 38 stay on purpose (the taggers did not agree). Back-fill report after:
  `phase_body_mismatch 0`, `hook_tags_over_cap 0`, `unknown_hook_tags 0`. Realms pushed.
* `--due` before: "due: no review recorded", exit 3. `--mark-reviewed` at 2026-09-30T18:12:51Z; `--due` then exit 0
  ("not due"); `--json` lists 0 since the review.

## Other checks walked

* **R-97, task 2 (first half):** PR-A merged; the merged blob written over `~/.claude/skills/inbox-apply/SKILL.md`; C-2
  `cmp` `0`; OneDrive stub `.md` count `0`; installed Step 0 prints
  `vault=C:/Users/stack/vault ingest=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness/ingest realm=projects ok`. 541–544 archived = 4
  (checked 2026-09-29), `v_inbox_queue` = 0.
* **L20-a (task 17):** Stack ran `install.mjs` at 16:51Z: 14 files installed, all 35 verified byte-identical, backup
  `~/.claude/hooks/backup-2026-09-30T16-51-58-190Z`. C-17: `same` x6 (harness `ea0e199`).
* **Task 20 (B-55):** gitleaks 8.30.1, `gitleaks git <V>/<realm> --redact`, 2026-09-29 ~18:14Z: projects 6 commits /
  5.50 MB, classes 2 commits / 1.09 MB, harness 4 commits / 1.55 MB; each exit 0, no leaks.
* **Task 21 (PR-C skills):** `install-checkpoint --repo` from harness `ea0e199`; C-21 `equal / equal / equal / 1 / 1`;
  Step 0 through `resolve-config.mjs` checked in six cases (live ok; classes realm STOP; BOM and space ok; missing vault
  STOP; missing machine file STOP; a quote in the path STOP as unsafe).
* **Task 22 (R-B4 credential test):** exit 2 in 2064 ms; all three realms "error (credential missing or rejected for
  origin: fatal: could not read Username for 'https://github.com': terminal prompts disabled)". A normal push right
  after: projects `clean->pulled->pushed`, classes and harness up-to-date, exit 0.

## Deviations from the brief

1. **Three-night live-lane prerequisite waived by Stack** (2026-09-30: "I don't want to wait 3 nights. If last night
   worked fine we are good to go."). Night 1 (2026-09-30T07:02Z) was clean for all three realms. L20-a and L20-b ran
   after one night.
2. **The nightly is no longer a gate to close the phase** (Stack, 2026-09-30, the same message as the credential test).
   Task 22's three consecutive nights (C-22's twelve `1`s) are not collected.
3. **Acceptance step 7 (cloud `/checkpoint`) struck** by Stack (2026-09-30: "Leave the cloud checkpoint (feature is not
   that important)"). R-98 rests on tasks 12, 13 and 21.
4. **Credential test run by the PM, non-destructively** (task 22, on Stack's "lets do the credential test"): the stored
   GitHub credential was not removed; git ran the one command with an empty `credential.helper`
   (`GIT_CONFIG_COUNT=1 GIT_CONFIG_KEY_0=credential.helper GIT_CONFIG_VALUE_0=`, in bash). A first attempt from
   PowerShell was invalid (PowerShell drops an empty env value, so git failed on config parse before any network call)
   and was discarded.
5. **Task 23's search half needed Stack's interactive session.** The PM's headless chain (`claude -p`) passed C-23, but
   its notes carry origin `sdk-cli`, which the loader skips by design, so neither was in `rag.documents` and D11 could
   not be proven from it. Stack's interactive chain at 17:59Z closed A3, D6 and D11.
6. **Tasks 26 and 24 used Phase 12's family** (PM change 2026-09-30 on Stack's "complete tasks 24 and 26" now): no
   bb2dash PM session had started after L20-a, so the family is Phase 12's PM `17eb4995…`, the most recent phase PM
   whose whole family carries its phase and whose phase holds ≥ 5 docs.
7. **`absolute_files_modified` is 6, not 0, left on purpose** (PM call 2026-09-30). The paths sit outside any repo:
   Temp scratch (3 notes), the old OneDrive vault (1), a cloud `/home/user` path (1), and `bbc5feeb` (today's Phase 16 PM
   session, Temp scratch paths). C-18's check is restated as "0 absolute paths inside a known repo".
8. **Task 24's three 2026-09-09 migrations** differ from the stored statement only by the file's trailing newline:
   md5 of the file without its last byte equals the stored statement's md5 exactly; `length()` differences are the em
   dash (1 character, 3 bytes). No SQL drift.
9. **Known gap: note `b46dd7f8-419f-4146-bfda-c9c1af6cb0ed`** (`projects/bb2dash/sessions/`) is 0 bytes on disk since
   2026-09-29 09:48, first committed empty in `3728ab6` (night 1), not in `rag.documents`; its transcript is only on the
   retired laptop, so it cannot be rebuilt here. Its 21 workflow agents take `bb2dash` through the project-folder rule.
10. **Task 2's final real Apply run is pending** an Inbox item to apply. Its first step (installed copy, `cmp` 0, the
    Step 0 line, stub count 0) is done; `inbox-541..544` were archived before PR-A merged.
11. **Stale phase tags kept** (PM call 2026-09-30, Stack silent for two messages): where a wrong `phase` was cleared on a
    note with no transcript, its `phase-N` tag stays, since under H-3 a note with no `hook_tags` treats every tag as
    hand and hand tags are never removed. The phase filter reads the `phase` field, not tags.
12. **Idempotency defect found and repaired by hand:** `cp-cse_012fboK5z1h7BKejm8ct6NNv` (a cloud checkpoint note whose
    body had no trailing newline) had "## Session facts" glued to its last line, so a re-run kept re-rendering it
    (`changes 1`). The only note affected (grep); the PM inserted the line break (original in `<B>`).
13. **Former-home fix (harness PR #37):** dry run #1 found `repo_empty_underivable 182` and `absolute_files_modified 20`
    because old notes carry `C:/Users/estac/...` paths from the retired machine. PR #37 taught the back-fill that home;
    dry run #2 read `repo_empty_underivable 0`.

**Harness follow-ups (not Phase 20 blockers):** (1) `rerenderFacts` appends "## Session facts" without a leading newline
when the body lacks a trailing one (deviation 12); (2) marking a note `superseded` does not re-render the body's Status
row (`af3dc123`, `5e968395` read "concluded" in the body while frontmatter and store say `superseded`).

- **Harness #38 (2026-09-30, `429d25f`), from PR-C's `/code-review`:** the redaction read any key containing `pat` (path, Pattern, dispatch) as naming a secret and blanked its value everywhere, in the hook since 2026-09-21 (over-redaction only). Fixed to mask whole lookalike words, nested lookalike assignments capped at 8 (fails closed). Two independent adversarial differentials (650 probes; fully redacted 499 on the old code, 517 now; only formatless values after lookalike keys are redacted less, by design); accepted residue ECOMPAT, TELECOMPAT, GHPATH. hooks 1106/1106. PR-C's `/checkpoint` reinstalled from `429d25f` (C-21 `equal` x3). New session notes use it after the hook reinstall.

V-2 closed on Stack's word (Stack, 2026-09-30: "V-2 is closed. Merge.").
