# 103 · W-70 verification (screens B)

Worker W-70, branch `feat/styling-22-screens-b`, worktree `bb2dash-wt-22-screens-b`. Merged `origin/feat/styling-22`
(ea91c9a) first, a merge; the start check passed (`web/e2e/phone-width.spec.ts` and `web/test/TopNav.fold.test.tsx`
both exist on the phase branch, `git cat-file -e` exit 0 each).

## Task 14: the gradebook scrolls inside its own box; the routes of rows 05-12 fit at 390 px

Commits: `53cab10` test (RED), `0f94ea4` feat (GREEN).

### RED, then GREEN

| Step | Command | Exit | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| RED, unit | `cd web && npx vitest run test/GradesTables.layout.test.tsx test/gradebook-phone-width.css.test.ts` | 1 | 4 failed, 4 passed (8): the wrapper rule has no `overflow-x`, no `min-width: 0`, no hook in the source, no hook in the rendered DOM. The layout test (3 cases) and the th/td case pass. |
| RED, harness | `node scripts/walk-box.mjs web/e2e/phone-width.spec.ts -- -g "route /course/\|route /grades \|route /materials \|route /workspace "` from a detached worktree at `53cab10` | 1 | run `20261008T234852Z`: 12 passed, 4 failed. Page `scrollWidth`: `/grades` 505 (both themes), `/course/IST.466/grades` 642 (both themes); the other six routes 390. |
| GREEN, unit | same unit command | 0 | 2 files, 8 passed, 0 failed |
| GREEN, harness | same harness command from this worktree at `0f94ea4` | 0 | run `20261008T235232Z`: `exit_code` 0, `result` `passed`, 16 passed, 0 failed |

The harness pattern in the task row is written `\|` between alternatives. Playwright's `-g` takes a JavaScript
regular expression, where `\|` is a literal bar and would select nothing, so the plain `|` was used. It selects the
same 16 titles (5 `/course/` routes, `/grades`, `/materials`, `/workspace`, each in both themes).

Page `scrollWidth` per route, GREEN run `20261008T235232Z` (all 390, dark and light):
`/course/IST.352/stream`, `/course/IST.471/classwork`, `/course/IST.466/grades`, `/course/IST.466/info`,
`/course/IST.471/assignment/IST.471/a1-proposal`, `/grades`, `/materials`, `/workspace`.

Which of the eight were too wide, and by how much, at RED: only the two gradebook routes (`/grades` 505, so 115 px too
wide; `/course/IST.466/grades` 642, 252 px). Both render `GradebookTable`, so the one scroll box fixes both. The
candidates the brief named (`white-space: nowrap` in `CourseSubBar` and `Materials`) did not overflow at 390 px; no
other file needed a change.

The task row also asks that, on `/course/IST.466/grades`, the scroll box's `scrollWidth` be greater than its
`clientWidth`, read from the frozen hook. The spec as it stands on the phase branch does not read the hook (it asserts
the page's `scrollWidth` only) and `web/e2e/` is not mine to edit, so that reading was not made. What shows the box
scrolls: the page `scrollWidth` went from 642 to 390 with the table's width unchanged. The hook itself is proven by
the unit test (one element carries it, it wraps both tables, it carries the `.wrap` class).

### What changed

* `web/src/components/grades/GradebookTable.tsx`: `<div className={styles.wrap} data-scroll-box="gradebook">`.
* `web/src/components/grades/GradebookTable.module.css`: `.wrap` gains `min-width: 0` and `overflow-x: auto`. Nothing on
  `th` or `td`. No size literal added, so `screens-b.json` is unchanged (no baseline moved).
* `web/test/gradebook-phone-width.css.test.ts` (new, 5 cases): the wrapper rule has `overflow-x: auto` and no vertical
  scroll or `overflow` shorthand; it has `min-width: 0`; no `th` / `td` rule in either grades stylesheet sets
  `overflow*` or `display`; the source carries the hook once on `className={styles.wrap}`; the rendered table has one
  hook element, with the wrapper class, around both tables.

### The checks of the task row, each by itself

### Defaults taken

1. The scroll box is `.wrap`, the existing element around both tables and the bookkeeping toggle (the Contract allows
   "`.wrap` or an inner element"). The toggle button therefore sits inside the box and slides with the tables if they
   are scrolled; it is pinned left by `align-self: flex-start`.
2. `min-width: 0` is added with `overflow-x: auto`: the card that holds the table is a grid / flex child and without it
   the box would widen its parent instead of scrolling.
3. The harness `-g` pattern uses a plain `|` (see above).
4. No `ui-ux-pro-max` section: task 14 changes no drawn look (the task list names 12, 13, 16 to 19 and 26 to 38 for the
   skill). The section is owed with W-70's sweep.

## Tokens my sweep needs

Survey of the whole W-70 cluster (`screens-b`, 66 files, baseline total 72) with the scanner of
`web/test/token-audit.scan.ts` and the frozen allowlist, plus the literal `font-weight` declarations the Weight check
looks for. Counts: 69 size literals and 3 `color-mix()` (72, the baseline), 0 colour literals, 0 TSX style keys, 4
literal weights. `1px` and `2px` and the A3 pinned declarations need no token and are not listed. Line numbers are the
files as of commit `0f94ea4` (GT counts the six comment and rule lines task 14 added); the Stream timeline is `components/course/CourseTimeline.module.css`
(CT below), `app/(app)/course/[id]/classwork/CourseClasswork.module.css` is CC, `app/(app)/materials/Materials.module.css`
is MT, `app/(app)/course/[id]/info/CourseInfo.module.css` is CI, `app/(app)/course/[id]/CourseSubBar.module.css` is SB,
`components/grades/GradebookTable.module.css` is GT.

Already declared and reused, so not listed: `11px` is `--text-xs` (CT 122, 193, 281, 352); `13.5px` is `--text-base`
(CT 288). The seven `--space-*` and the three `--radius-*` have no exact match for any remaining literal. D's 34 new
names are not asked for under another name; `--font-heading-weight` is 500 today but it is the heading weight and D
moves it to 600, so the plain 500 asks for its own name below.

| Name | Today's value | Where it is used |
|---|---|---|
| `--text-3xs` (first asked as `--text-9`) | `9px` | font-size: CC 116; MT 176, 196; CT 66, 199, 299, 310, 336, 423, 469, 510 |
| `--text-2xs` (first asked as `--text-10`) | `10px` | font-size: CC 68, 99; CI 64, 111; MT 112, 118; GT 25 |
| `--text-10-5` | `10.5px` | font-size: CT 46 |
| `--text-11-5` | `11.5px` | font-size: CT 147, 213, 293 |
| `--text-12` | `12px` | font-size: CT 249, 325 |
| `--text-13` | `13px` | font-size: CT 377 |
| `--size-3` | `3px` | gap CT 273; padding CT 324 (`3px var(--space-3)`) |
| `--size-4` | `4px` | padding SB 18; gap SB 69 |
| `--size-5` | `5px` | padding CC 100 (`1px 5px`) |
| `--size-6` | `6px` | padding: CC 76, 125; CT 200, 300, 308, 378, 421, 509 |
| `--size-8` | `8px` | padding SB 70 (`1px 8px`) |
| `--size-9` | `9px` | width MT 114 (the bucket caret) |
| `--size-16` | `16px` | width and height: CT 331, 332, 503, 504 |
| `--size-22` | `22px` | height CT 38 |
| `--size-28` | `28px` | width and height MT 168, 169; flex-basis calc MT 253; width CT 37 |
| `--size-32` | `32px` | width and height: CT 244, 245, 492, 493; padding calc CT 448 |
| `--size-44` | `44px` | grid-template-columns CT 22 |
| `--size-60` | `60px` | grid-template-columns: CT 411, 412 (inside the 600px container step) |
| `--size-72` | `72px` | grid-template-columns: CT 114 (`.laneHeadSingle`), 172 (`.undated`); the pinned `.laneHead` / `.weekRow` tracks are A3 and keep their literal |
| `--size-assignment-max` | `760px` | the assignment page frame, `width: min(760px, 100%)`: `course/[id]/assignment/[...assignmentId]/CourseAssignment.module.css` 9 |
| `--size-conversations-min` | `14rem` | Workspace conversation column, `minmax(14rem, 18rem)`: `app/(app)/workspace/Workspace.module.css` 8 |
| `--size-conversations-max` | `18rem` | same declaration |
| `--size-report-card-min` | `11rem` | `components/grades/ReportCardStrip.module.css` 20 (`.card` min-width) |
| `--size-report-card-max` | `16rem` | `components/grades/ReportCardStrip.module.css` 21 (`.card` max-width) |
| `--color-accent-tint-6` | `color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-accent) 6%, transparent)` | background: `components/grades/GradeModel.module.css` 14 |
| `--color-accent-tint-7` | `color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-accent) 7%, transparent)` | background: CT 177 |
| `--color-accent-tint-12` | `color-mix(in srgb, var(--color-accent) 12%, transparent)` | background: CT 499 |
| `--font-weight-regular` | `400` | font-weight: GT 45 (`.nameCell`) |
| `--font-weight-medium` | `500` | font-weight: MT 137; CT 250 |
| `--font-weight-semibold` | `600` | font-weight: MT 25 (`.courseCode`) |

That is 30 names: 6 `--text-*`, 18 `--size-*`, 3 `--color-*`, 3 `--font-*`. Notes for task 8:

* The three tints are `--color-*`, so each needs a light-block declaration; today's value is the same expression in
  both themes (it resolves against `--color-accent`, which D points at the ink in both).
* `--size-4`, `--size-5`, `--size-6`, `--size-8` and `--size-3` are spacing used for padding and gaps in modules that
  have no `--space-*` step that equals them (the seven `--space-*` are 2.8, 5.6, 8.4, 11.2, 16.8, 22.4 and 33.6 px).
  If another table asks for the same px value under another `--size-*` name, one name per value is enough: say so in
  the task 8 commit and I use the name `globals.css` declares.
* A name this table lacks is reported, not invented: none is known to be missing.

I do not start the sweep (task 19): it waits for W-67's task 8.

## Waiting for

W-67's task 8 (the token declarations, `.errorNotice`, the light block) before the sweep, task 19. Nothing in this task
was blocked by another worker's file: all 16 cases of rows 05-12 pass.

## Resume: after W-67's task 8

Merged `origin/feat/styling-22` (a merge). The five start checks each printed one line (`data-theme='light'` in
`globals.css`; `^\.errorNotice` in `tokens.module.css`; `motion-control`; `size-target`; `attemptText`).

* **Names corrected.** The PM ruled one name per value: 10px type is `--text-2xs` and 9px is `--text-3xs`; there is no
  `--text-10` or `--text-9`. The two rows of the table above now carry the declared names, with the first-asked name
  beside each.
* **Token names**, printed: `68 38 0`, `69 53 0`, `70 31 0`. (31, not 30: the command's pattern also reads the
  `--size-4, ...` bullet of the notes under the table, which starts with a backticked name.)
* **The gradebook hook, closed.** W-68's spec now reads it. Run `20261009T001508Z` printed
  `route /course/IST.466/grades [dark]: box scrollWidth=620 clientWidth=345` (the same in light). The box scrolls.

## ui-ux-pro-max

Required by the brief's working rules (amendment 3, H-1). One row per task that changes what is drawn.

| Task | Skill loaded | Files read first | Searches run | Advice set aside, and the rule that won |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 19, 28, 31, 34, 37 | yes (Skill tool, `ui-ux-pro-max`, once at the start of the resume, before task 19) | `design-system/bb2dash/MASTER.md` (all of it), `design-system/bb2dash/pages/grades.md`, `design-system/bb2dash/pages/workspace.md`; `direction-d.json` and `component-changes.json` for every value and entry | none. The brief names every rule these tasks write, the component-changes entries give each change word for word, and `direction-d.json` holds every value, so a query would only have returned advice the brief already overrides. No `--persist` was passed and no script ran | `touch-target-size` (44 px) and `web-target-size` lose to `--size-target` (task 36, not mine); `readable-font-size` (16 px body) and the type-floor advice lose to the seven pinned `--text-*` sizes and the brief's "no 11px floor" (D-2); `weight-hierarchy` loses to the sweep's rule that weights are `--font-weight-*` tokens at today's value; `truncation-strategy` and `spring-physics` do not apply (these tasks truncate and animate nothing new); the icon-package advice (a Phosphor import) loses to "no new dependency": the marks are the inline SVGs of `icons.tsx`; `grades.md` lines 21-22, 34, 36 and 37 ("waits", "needs his word") are read against D-2, D-3, D-5 and H-5 and the brief's table of overtaken lines: all of them are now in (tasks 28, 31, 34, 37) |
| 26 (my line) | yes (Skill tool, at the start of the task) | `design-system/bb2dash/MASTER.md`; the brief's frame section and task row | none (the brief names the one line) | `fixed-element-offset` and `scroll-behavior` lose to D-1, the frame with scrolling panes: no bar lies over a scrolling page any more |
| visual round (V-10 to V-13) | yes (Skill tool, at the start of the round) | `design-system/bb2dash/MASTER.md`, `pages/grades.md` | none (see `## Visual round`) | none set aside |

## Task 19: the sweep of screens B

Commit `18dd4ce`. Every size literal, `color-mix()` and literal weight in the 66 files of the cluster is a token
reference at today's value. `screens-b.json` is set to 0 for all ten files in the same commit.

* **Dead rules deleted, and the Serif check.** `GradeModel.module.css` held 31 classes; its two renderers
  (`LinkColumnControl.tsx`, `ScoreHistory.tsx`) use seven. The other 24 (the "Our model" container with the 6% mix, the
  what-if cell, the solver, the actions, the old table, `.srOnly`) were dead since Phase 12b and went, **its table head
  with them**. So the Serif check's target reads `7 0 0`, not `8 0 0`. `GradesTables.layout.test.tsx` (unedited) still
  finds `modelStyles.link`, which stays.
* **Entries applied.** 29 `.openLink` and 30 `.itemLink` on the global link style (the colour, `text-decoration: none`
  and the hover rules are gone; `.itemLink` keeps one `:active` rule for the dim). 42: `.tabActive` and `.weekCurrent`
  name `--color-accent-500` (`.weekCurrent` also `--color-on-accent`). 23: the six boxed error rules compose
  `errorNotice` and drop their own fill and colour (padding, radius and size stay). 59: `user-select: none` on the
  course tabs (with `-webkit-user-drag: none`, they are anchors) and on the gradebook head. 60: the focus rules of the
  cluster draw `var(--size-focus) solid var(--color-accent)` with `--size-focus-gap` (inset on the rows that sit flush
  in a clipped box, as before). 64: `transition: var(--motion-control)` on the course tabs. 65: `opacity: 0.7` while
  held on `.openLink`, `.itemLink`, both `.bbLink` and `.emptyLink`.
* **Kept as they were (A3, A5 and pins).** The `.laneHead` and `.weekRow` tracks with their `72px minmax(240px, 1fr)`
  floors, `.asgRow`'s `32px minmax(0, 1fr) minmax(7.5rem, 9rem)`, the `@container (max-width: 600px)` step, and
  `CourseClasswork.tsx`'s one `marginLeft` key. `course-timeline-css.test.ts`, `Workspace.layout.test.tsx` and
  `CourseClasswork.test.tsx` are unedited and green.
* **Not done here (task 26).** `CourseTimeline.module.css`'s `.rail` `position: sticky` (my line of task 26) is as it was.

### The named commands, as printed

| Command | Exit | Printed |
|---|---|---|
| Baseline sum, `F=/^screens-b\.json$/` | 0 | `0` |
| Time check over the screens B stylesheets | 1 | nothing |
| No-select check over `CourseSubBar.module.css` and `GradebookTable.module.css` | 0 | `2 0 0` |
| `grep -c "transition: var(--motion-control)" "web/src/app/(app)/course/[id]/CourseSubBar.module.css"` | 0 | `1` |
| Weight check over `"web/src/app/(app)/materials" web/src/components/course web/src/components/grades` (and over the other five folders of the cluster) | 1 | nothing |
| Red files over `"web/src/app/(app)/course" web/src/components/course` | 0 | `CourseSubBar.module.css` and `CourseTimeline.module.css` (2 lines) |
| Notice files over the five paths of the row | 0 | six lines: `CourseAssignment`, `Materials`, `Workspace` (under `app/(app)`), `UploadDropZone`, `ConversationList`, `ServiceStatus` |
| `grep -c "var(--color-on-accent)" web/src/components/course/CourseTimeline.module.css` | 0 | `1` |
| Ring check | 0 | `29 21 3` over all of `web/src`; none of the 21 is in the cluster |
| `cd web && npx vitest run test/token-audit.test.ts` | 0 | 89 passed |
| `cd web && npm test` | 0 | 164 files, 3238 passed, 0 failed |
| `npm run typecheck`; `npx eslint . --max-warnings 0` | 0; 0 | no error; no output |

RED was the audit itself: with the sweep in and the JSON still at 72, `token-audit.test.ts` failed on
`screens-b: every file is at its baseline` with ten "counts 0, below its baseline" lines; setting the JSON to 0 made
it green.

## Task 28: type, titles and dates

Commit `f9040e7`. The gradebook head takes `--font-body` at `--font-weight-medium` (a small-capital head, so the Weight
check stays empty); the "seen" stamp loses `tokens.mono`. `git grep -c "font-family: var(--font-heading)" --
GradebookTable.module.css GradeModel.module.css` prints nothing (exit 1); `grep -c "tokens.mono"
web/src/components/grades/GradebookTable.tsx` prints `0`; the Weight check over the cluster prints nothing; the Serif
check over my two rules prints `1 0 0` (one block found, since `GradeModel`'s head is gone). `npm test`: 164 files,
3238 passed; typecheck and eslint exit 0.

## Task 34: captions and codes

Commit `7e2099a`. `GradebookTable.tsx` prints `submission.attemptText` inside the `submission.attemptStatus &&` it had.
`GradebookTable.test.tsx` changed on lines 61 and 119 only.

| Command | Exit | Printed |
|---|---|---|
| `grep -c "submission.attemptText" web/src/components/grades/GradebookTable.tsx` | 0 | `1` |
| `grep -c "last attempt: needs grading" web/test/GradebookTable.test.tsx` | 0 | `2` |
| `git diff --numstat origin/main...HEAD -- web/test/GradebookTable.test.tsx` | 0 | `2	2	web/test/GradebookTable.test.tsx` |
| `cd web && npx vitest run test/GradebookTable.test.tsx test/status-vocabulary.test.ts` | 0 | 2 files, 36 passed |

## Task 37: busy says busy

Commit `9d85a10`. `aria-busy` beside the five `disabled` sites of the row. `git grep -c -E
"aria-busy=\{(pending|busy)\}"` over the four files prints `LinkColumnControl.tsx:2`, `UploadDropZone.tsx:1`,
`OpenStoredButton.tsx:1`, `ConversationList.tsx:1`; `grep -c "aria-busy" web/src/components/shell/TopNav.tsx` prints
`1`. `npm test`: 164 files, 3238 passed. No stylesheet of mine carries a rule for it (the five rules of the busy look
belong to other workers).

## Task 31: marks

Commit `19f7ba3`, after W-68's `icons.tsx` commit (`git grep -c "export function Mark"` printed `:2`, `git grep -c
"export const MARK_CHAR"` printed `:1`). 18 characters in 9 files drawn by `Mark`: `TimelineRows.tsx` (close),
`CourseGradeCard.tsx` (fold caret, "Open ... →"), `FileOpenAction.tsx`, `MaterialsBrowser.tsx` (two fold carets, "Open
in Classwork →", "Blackboard ↗"), `CourseSubBar.tsx`, `CourseClasswork.tsx`, `CourseGrades.tsx`, `CourseInfo.tsx`,
`CourseStream.tsx`.

* **Mark characters, before and after** (the command over all of `web/src`): before `41 20`, after `23 11`. W-70's fall
  is 18 characters in 9 files, as the brief says; the 23 and 11 left are the other workers'.
* A right arrow after a link's words is `<Mark name="caretRight" char={MARK_CHAR.arrowRight} />`, so the glyph stands in
  `icons.tsx` only. The two carets that were `aria-hidden` sit in the same `aria-hidden` span.
* `CourseStream.tsx`'s two labels keep their values (`` `Open ${MARK_CHAR.arrowUpRight}` `` is `'Open ↗'`) and are drawn
  through `MarkedLabel`; so is `FileOpenAction.tsx`'s fallback.
* `grep -c "<MarkedLabel"`: `FileOpenAction.tsx` 1, `MaterialsBrowser.tsx` 2, `CourseStream.tsx` 1.
* `cd web && npx vitest run test/course-stream.history.test.tsx test/FileOpenAction.test.tsx
  test/MaterialsCourseLinks.test.tsx test/CourseClasswork.test.tsx` → exit 0, 4 files, 57 passed, unedited.
* `cd web && npm test` → exit 0, 167 files, 3301 passed; typecheck exit 0; eslint exit 0; audit exit 0.
* **Default.** `MaterialsBrowser.tsx` renders `STAGED_LABEL` twice (the link, and a plain span when there is no
  Blackboard link). The brief's "stays typed" rule is for `SubmissionBlock.tsx:98` and its `getByText`; no test reads
  `MaterialsBrowser`'s span that way (no test mentions `STAGED_LABEL`), so both are drawn through `MarkedLabel`.

## Harness run: owed

`node scripts/walk-box.mjs web/e2e/phone-width.spec.ts -- -g "route /course/|route /grades |route /materials |route /workspace "`
from this worktree at `19f7ba3`: run `20261009T005344Z`, `exit_code` 1, **16 failed**. Every case fails before it
measures anything, at `bodyFontLoaded` (`phone-width.spec.ts:182`): `a face of Source Sans 3 with status "loaded"`,
30 s timeout. A repeat of `route /grades ` alone (run `20261009T010534Z`) failed the same way, so it is not a flake.
The cause is not in my files: the failing precondition is the page's body font, which comes from the Google Fonts
`@import` in `web/src/app/globals.css` (W-67's, task 8) and the box. W-67's own run `20261009T004202Z` of the public
pages fails at the same line. I did not wait or poll for it. Widths are therefore **not re-measured** since the sweep;
the last measured widths are the GREEN run of task 14 (`20261008T235232Z`, all 16 at 390). The sweep swaps literals
for tokens at the same value and the marks are 1em inline SVGs where a one-character glyph stood, so no box is
expected to move. **Owed:** this run, 16 passed, once the font loads in the box.

## Harness run: done

After W-67's fonts fix (`ca52b96`), merged with `origin/feat/styling-22` (merge, no rebase). Before the run on the
merged tree: `npm test` exit 0 (169 files, 3307 passed), typecheck 0, eslint 0, `token-audit.test.ts` 0 failures
(89 passed), Baseline sum for `screens-b.json` still `0`. The tree was committed and pushed.

from the worktree root: run `20261009T012804Z`, commit `e1bd30a`, `dirty` false, `exit_code` 0, `result` `passed`,
count line `16 passed (52.9s)`, 0 failed. Printed widths: `page scrollWidth=390` on all eight routes in dark and light
(`/course/IST.352/stream`, `/course/IST.471/classwork`, `/course/IST.466/grades`, `/course/IST.466/info`,
`/course/IST.471/assignment/IST.471/a1-proposal`, `/grades`, `/materials`, `/workspace`). On `/course/IST.466/grades`
the gradebook box prints `box scrollWidth=588 clientWidth=345` in both themes, so the table scrolls inside its box.
No route is too wide with the new font; nothing owed from the harness. The line of task 26 is not started.

## Round 2

From the first `/code-review main high`. Merged `origin/feat/styling-22` first (already up to date).

### R2-4 (MEDIUM): the card-note field flashed as switched off during a save

Commit `4420f1a`. `CourseInfo.tsx` `CardNoteField`'s input (`tokens.input`) is `disabled={disabled || save.isPending}`;
it now also carries `aria-busy={save.isPending}`, so `.input:disabled:not([aria-busy='true'])` does not reach it.

* **RED** (`web/test/CourseInfo.busy.test.tsx`, new; `CourseInfo.test.tsx` unedited): `npx vitest run
  test/CourseInfo.busy.test.tsx test/MaterialsBrowser.marks.test.tsx` → exit 1; the pending case failed (the field was
  disabled and had no `aria-busy`), the idle case passed.
* **GREEN:** the same file → both cases pass; with the old files, 6 files, 57 passed.
* **Every `disabled=` in my files, read:**

| Site | Expression | Element | Decision |
|---|---|---|---|
| `CourseInfo.tsx:168` | `disabled \|\| save.isPending` | `tokens.input` | **changed**: `aria-busy={save.isPending}` |
| `CourseInfo.tsx:341` | `isQueryLoading(shellsQ) \|\| !noteShellId` | prop `disabled` into the same field | left: a query-loading or missing-shell state, not a pending save; the field is off then |
| `LinkColumnControl.tsx:67`, `:85` | `pending` | `GradeModel` `.select` (composes `.input`); a ghost button | already `aria-busy={pending}` (task 37) |
| `UploadDropZone.tsx:97` | `busy` | the hidden file input | already `aria-busy={busy}` |
| `OpenStoredButton.tsx:58` | `pending` | a button | already `aria-busy={pending}` |
| `ConversationList.tsx:78` | `busy` | a button | already `aria-busy={busy}` |
| `Composer.tsx:104` | `disabled` | the textarea (`.box` composes `.input`) | left: `disabled` is `empty === 'missing'` (an unknown conversation), a real off state |
| `Composer.tsx:115` | `busy \|\| disabled` | the Ask button (`.button` composes `btnPrimary`) | left: a button, not one of the five switched-off rules (`.input`, `StatusSelect`, `Popout` `.control`, `SearchPanel` `.courseSelect`, `PlannerItemPopover` `.control`) |
| `Workspace.tsx:268` | `empty === 'missing'` | a prop for `Composer` | left: not a pending flag |

* **Busy sites** (the command as written, which counts only `aria-busy={pending}` and `aria-busy={busy}`) prints
  `24 8` on this branch: 8 are on it (W-67's 3 and mine, 5). It is unchanged by this fix (`aria-busy={save.isPending}`
  is not in the command's pattern). The target `24 24` is the integrated branch's.

### R2-6 (MEDIUM): the reading route links typed their arrow

Commit `4719a7e`. `MaterialsBrowser.tsx`'s link `<a>` for a reading with an external or Blackboard route rendered
`{route.action}` raw; it is now `<MarkedLabel label={route.action} />`. The strings in `lib/queries.materials.ts` do
not change.

* **RED** (`web/test/MaterialsBrowser.marks.test.tsx`, new): both cases (`Open ↗`, `In Blackboard ↗`) failed with "expected
  null not to be null": no drawn `svg[aria-hidden]` in the link.
* **GREEN:** both pass: the link's text content equals the label and it holds the drawn mark.
* **The second look, strings from the `.ts` libraries reaching the page in my files:** `queries.materials.ts` actions:
  the link branch (fixed), the `FileOpenAction` fallback and `action` (already `MarkedLabel`, task 31), the
  `OpenStoredButton label` (`'Open'`, no arrow) and the disabled button (`'On Blackboard'`, `'No route'`, no arrow);
  `STAGED_LABEL` (both renderings already `MarkedLabel`); `sync-request-phase.ts:115` and `inbox-row.ts:166,168` are
  rendered in W-68's and W-69's files, none in mine. Nothing else found.

### The gates

| Command | Exit | Printed |
|---|---|---|
| `npx vitest run test/MaterialsCourseLinks.test.tsx test/FileOpenAction.test.tsx test/course-stream.history.test.tsx test/CourseInfo.test.tsx` and the two new files | 0 | 6 files, 57 passed; the old files unedited |
| Mark characters | 0 | `23 11`: none of the remaining is in my files (they are the other workers') |
| `cd web && npm test` | 0 | 171 files, 3311 passed |
| `npm run typecheck`; `npx eslint . --max-warnings 0` | 0; 0 | no error; no output |
| `cd web && npx vitest run test/token-audit.test.ts` | 0 | 89 passed; `screens-b.json` sums to 0 |

## Task 26: my line (the Stream's week rail sticks to the pane)

Merged `origin/feat/styling-22` first. The row's checks: `git grep -c "scrollbar-gutter: stable" origin/feat/styling-22 --
"web/src/app/(app)/Shell.module.css"` printed `:1`; `git grep -c "position: sticky" origin/feat/styling-22 --
web/src/components/shell/TopNav.module.css` printed nothing (exit 1).

* **ui-ux-pro-max (task 26).** Loaded at the start of the task; read `design-system/bb2dash/MASTER.md` first. No search
  run: the brief's frame section and the task row name the one line. Advice set aside: `fixed-element-offset` (reserve
  padding under a fixed bar) and `scroll-behavior` (avoid nested scroll regions) lose to D-1, the frame with scrolling
  panes; with the bar no longer over a scrolling page, the offset is gone by design.
* **The change** (commit `feat(22-T26): the Stream's week rail sticks to the pane`): `CourseTimeline.module.css` `.rail`
  `top: calc(var(--nav-height) + var(--space-4))` becomes `top: var(--space-4)`. What is sticky now sticks to the
  pane, which starts under the bar.
* **Checks:** `grep -c "nav-height" web/src/components/course/CourseTimeline.module.css` → `0` (exit 1); `cd web && npx
  vitest run test/course-timeline-css.test.ts test/CourseTimeline.test.tsx` → exit 0, 2 files, 26 passed, both
  unedited; `cd web && npm test` → exit 0, 181 files, 3381 passed; `npm run typecheck` → 0; `npx eslint . --max-warnings 0`
  → 0; `npx vitest run test/token-audit.test.ts` → 0, `screens-b.json` still 0.

### Harness runs on the committed and pushed tree (commit `4675ff0`, `dirty` false)

| Run | Command | Result |
|---|---|---|
| `20261009T032625Z` | `node scripts/walk-box.mjs web/e2e/phone-width.spec.ts -- -g "route /course/|route /grades |route /materials |route /workspace "` | `exit_code` 0, `passed`, `16 passed (49.2s)`, 0 failed |
| `20261009T032835Z` | `node scripts/walk-box.mjs web/e2e/workspace-layout.spec.ts` (unedited) | `exit_code` 0, `passed`, `2 passed (740ms)`, 0 failed |

Printed in run `20261009T032625Z`, every route in dark and light: `page scrollWidth=390 pane scrollWidth=380
clientWidth=380` (the pane is 10 px narrower than the page by its stable gutter, and it does not overflow). On
`/course/IST.466/grades`, in both themes, `box scrollWidth=452 clientWidth=335`: the gradebook box is still wider than
its window and scrolls inside itself. The Workspace's message column still scrolls inside its own box and the page does
not grow below the window (`workspace-layout.spec.ts`).

The frame broke nothing on my screens: no failure in either run, so nothing to fix in my files and no element of another
worker's to name.

## Visual round

From the PM's theme walk with shots (run `20261009T034707Z`, 64 passed) judged against tile D. Merged
`origin/feat/styling-22` first. I opened `05-grades-dark.png` only, and describe no course data from it.

**ui-ux-pro-max (visual round).** Loaded at the start; read `design-system/bb2dash/MASTER.md` and `pages/grades.md`
(read earlier in this resume, and again for the "Shape" and "Typography" rules). No search run: each item is a rule
the design system and `component-changes.json` already state. Advice set aside: none needed; `element-state` rules
(`state-clarity`) agree with the Seen stamp keeping its quiet colour; `truncation-strategy` is not touched.

| Item | Caused by this phase? | What `main` did | What changed |
|---|---|---|---|
| V-10 strip tiles | Yes, by the card-edge change (task 16, entry `card-edge`) | `main`'s `.card` (tokens) had no edge at all: a fill and a radius, no ring, so the scroll box (`.cards`, `overflow-x: auto`, `padding: 0 0 var(--space-2)`) had nothing to clip. Since task 16 the edge is a 1px `box-shadow` ring, which lies outside the padding box; a scroll box clips it on the top and left and on the last tile's right | `.cards` pads the ring back in (`padding: var(--size-underline) var(--size-underline) calc(var(--space-2) + var(--size-underline))`) and takes it back with `margin: calc(var(--size-underline) * -1)`: no box moves, and each tile has its whole edge. A strip wider than its pane still scrolls sideways inside its own box |
| V-11 "scroll up for weeks" | Not caused by the sweep; the gap is main's | `main`'s `.earlier` is a `button` with no `font-family` (a button does not inherit it), so it took the browser's face; it only stands out now that the app's face is Source Sans | `font-family: var(--font-body)` on `.earlier`. The typed up-arrow is not one of D-3's characters (the Mark characters command does not list `↑`) and stays |
| V-12 "tentative" tag | Yes, by task 8's token values | `main`'s `.tentativeTag` was a dashed box with `border-radius: calc(var(--radius-md) * 0.75)`; `--radius-md` was 8px, so 6px. Task 8 set `--radius-md` to 4px, so the same expression drew 3px: a square-ish corner. The entry `tag-pill` gives a tag `--radius-chip` "in place of `calc(var(--radius-md) * 0.75)`" | `.tentativeTag` and its sibling `.attendanceTag` (the identical expression) take `var(--radius-chip)`. The dashes (`1px dashed`) say "tentative" on `main` and stay. `CourseSubBar`'s `.dispute` label has the same expression; the brief's entry names it as not a tag, so it is left (and recorded here) |
| V-13 Seen stamp | Yes, by my task 28 | `main`'s `.mono` class set `font-family`, `font-size: var(--text-xs)` (11px) and `color: var(--color-neutral-400)` | The stamp lost all three when the class came off, and grew to the table's `--text-base`. `.seenCell` now sets `font-size: var(--text-xs)` and `color: var(--color-neutral-400)` (no `font-family`, D-2). Same size and colour as `main`. The popout's stamp is W-68's file |

* **Test.** `web/test/visual-round-b.css.test.ts` (new, 8 cases): the strip's scroll box and its ring padding and margin; `.earlier`'s face; both tag rules on `--radius-chip` and the tentative dashes kept; the Seen cell's size and colour and no code face.
  RED (before the CSS): `npx vitest run test/visual-round-b.css.test.ts` → exit 1, 5 failed, 3 passed (the 3 are the cases that
  already held: the strip is a scroll box, the dashes, no code face). GREEN: exit 0, 8 passed.
* **Gates.** `npx vitest run test/visual-round-b.css.test.ts test/course-timeline-css.test.ts test/CourseTimeline.test.tsx
  test/GradebookTable.test.tsx test/GradesTables.layout.test.tsx` → 0, 68 passed; `cd web && npm test` → 0, 183 files, 3410
  passed; `npm run typecheck` → 0; `npx eslint . --max-warnings 0` → 0; `npx vitest run test/token-audit.test.ts` → 0 (`screens-b.json` still 0).
* **Harness run** on the committed and pushed tree: run `20261009T041205Z`, commit `be4e30e`, `dirty` false, `exit_code` 0,
  `passed`, `16 passed (51.8s)`.
* **Recorded, no change asked** (not this phase's): columns that do not line up between course blocks on `/grades`;
  the item link sitting low beside its link select on a course's Grades tab; the native disclosure triangle on "N earlier";
  the assignment page marking Stream as the current tab; the faint small text on a dimmed no-class session card.
