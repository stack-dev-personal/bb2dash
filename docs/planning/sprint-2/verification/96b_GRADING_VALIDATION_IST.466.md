Other sources: `bb_file:21` (`IST466 Ethics Cases Spring 2026.docx`, filed under "Ethics Cases Fall 2026"), `bb_file:149` (`IST466M3 Schedule Fall2026-Wk4xyz.docx`, M003, v. Sept 17; `bb_file:150` is a near-copy), `bb_file:36` (`Ethics vs IST466_Fall 2026_M3.pptx`), `bb_file:20` and `bb_file:38` (the two copies of the ethics rubric deck), `bb_file:33` (the Student Policies appendix).

Export §6 questions for this course: Q1 (IST.466 attendance) is rows IST.466-22 to -24 and -29; Q4 is rows IST.466-29 and -30; Q5 is rows IST.466-15 and -16; Q11 is row IST.466-36; Q12 is row IST.466-13. The Major Case Group number in component 24's notes (#3 → #2, migration 105) is team membership, not grading, and was not assessed.

## Amendments (PM, 2026-09-29)

* IST.466-04 (letter_scale stored/value: the human list → prod's exact `letter_scale::text`, what the recheck returns).
* IST.466-05 (ai_policy stored/value → null: prod's `grading_schemes.ai_policy` is null since migration 119_strip_ai_policy_passages, 2026-09-29).
* IST.466-13 (stored/value → true: the recheck is a `like` test).
* IST.466-26 (stored/value → 0: the recheck counts ethics parts with a parent).
* IST.466-06 (stored/value → false/true: the recheck is a `like` test; the notes text moved to `why`).
* IST.466-11 (stored/value → false/true: the recheck is a `like` test; the notes text moved to `why`).
* IST.466-16 (stored/value → false/true: the recheck is a `like` test; the notes text moved to `why`).
* IST.466-29 (change_to 26 → keep null) and new IST.466-39 (mark_ungraded `_3562500_1`): Stack 2026-09-29, attendance and participation are separate categories, each on the syllabus's own points; attendance is the syllabus 150 on the 150-point column `_3562493_1`, and the 100-point Attendance column the syllabus does not name is "Not graded" (a `grade_column_links` excluded row, P-3), not merged.

## Questions

* **id:** IST.466-Q1
* **question:** Which classes count for attendance: every class at 5 points (30 × 5 = 150), or only the starred "1 out of 15" classes?
* **what it blocks:** IST.466-22, IST.466-23, IST.466-24, IST.466-29
* **evidence found:** `bb_file:39#unit:1` "up to 5 points for on-time attendance per class"; `bb_file:149#unit:1` "*indicates 1 out of 15 classes where attendance and participation counts." (8 classes starred)
* **options:** (a) 30 × 5; (b) 15 counted classes; (c) take whatever the gradebook posts, scaled to 150
* **recommendation:** keep 150 and ask the professor for the count
* **default if unanswered:** `tentative`
* **Stack's answer:** Schedule is ever changing, and I am not required to be at every class. Just simply go with what is posted in the gradebook for this. I haven't missed class thus far however I am not sure that the gradebook will be updated efficiently with this teacher.
* **date:** 2026-09-29
* **DECISIONS row?:** yes

* **id:** IST.466-Q2
* **question:** Presenters earn no participation on their own day, so a student can reach at most 90 of the 100 participation points. Which figure does the app show?
* **what it blocks:** IST.466-07, IST.466-11
* **evidence found:** `bb_file:39#unit:1` "up to 10 points for each of the 10 ethics presentations"; `bb_file:21#unit:1` "Students that are presenting do NOT earn participation points when they present."
* **options:** (a) show 90 as the practical cap; (b) show the syllabus 100 and note the cap; (c) ask the professor
* **recommendation:** (b)
* **default if unanswered:** (b)
* **Stack's answer:** b.
* **date:** 2026-09-29
* **DECISIONS row?:** no

* **id:** IST.466-Q3
* **question:** Does the 120-point "Rubrics for Ethics Case Presentation" deck govern the 100-point ethics case presentation?
* **what it blocks:** IST.466-15, IST.466-16
* **evidence found:** `bb_file:20#unit:1` "Rubrics for Ethics Case Presentation (120 pts.)", path "IST466/M1 Rubrics for Ethics Cases vs."; `bb_file:38#unit:1` same slide, filed under "Class Exercise - Fall 2026 Ethics!"; `bb_file:39#unit:1` "up to 100 points for a 40-minute ethics presentation"; `bb_file:36#unit:1` "Ethics Exercise (120 points)"
* **options:** (a) syllabus 100 governs, and the rubric is read as the Ethics vs. scoring guide; (b) the rubric's 120 governs, and the total becomes 1040; (c) ask the professor
* **recommendation:** (a)
* **default if unanswered:** (a), `tentative`
* **Stack's answer:** Pick according to my answer for Q2. (Applied: the syllabus figure governs, so (a).)
* **date:** 2026-09-29
* **DECISIONS row?:** no

* **id:** IST.466-Q4
* **question:** When a gradebook column's maximum differs from the syllabus value of the component it feeds, how is the component scored?
* **what it blocks:** IST.466-08, IST.466-10, IST.466-22, IST.466-24, IST.466-29, IST.466-30
* **evidence found:** none in materials (syllabus participation 100 vs a 150-point Blackboard column; one syllabus attendance item vs two Blackboard columns, 150 and 100)
* **options:** (a) earned ÷ possible across the component's posted columns, scaled to the syllabus points; (b) use raw column points; (c) ask the professor
* **recommendation:** (c), leaving the columns unlinked in the meantime
* **default if unanswered:** leave the columns unlinked (B-13)
* **Stack's answer:** Go with the syllabus points and assess my score based on the points scored over total points (from the gradebook column) scaled to the 100 points from the syllabus. (Extended to attendance at Stack's direction: "See previous answer to reason and decide on this one. Likely merge.")
* **date:** 2026-09-29
* **DECISIONS row?:** yes
