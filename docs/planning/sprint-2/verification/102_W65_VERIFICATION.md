# Phase 21 — W-65 (container stream) verification

Brief: `docs/planning/sprint-2/briefs/102_PHASE21_workspace.md` (frozen 2026-10-05) · Tasks 12, 13, 14 ·
bb2dash branch `feat/workspace-21-container` (worktree `bb2dash-wt-21-container`) · bb2dash-stack branch
`feat/workspace-21` (worktree `bb2dash-stack-wt-21`) · Wave 1 written 2026-10-05; wave 2 (rulings T1)
added 2026-10-06, at the end.

**Wave 1 is files and read-only checks only.** No `docker build`, `up`, `run`, `exec`, `stop` or `rm`
was run by this stream, and no `just` verb. The image has not been built, so nothing below proves that
the image builds or that the firewall works in a kernel. What wave 1 does prove is listed per task;
what waits for wave 2 is written out as paste-ready lines.

| task | wave 1 | waits for wave 2 |
|---|---|---|
| 12 | every file written; compose resolves; the `sync` service is unchanged; `grep-clean` 10 of 11 | the eleventh `grep-clean` test (needs W-64's `workspace/`), the build, every container check, the token smoke (PM) |
| 13 | the scan lines written | the scan itself (needs the image) |
| 14 | done: 46 of 46, every file check | nothing |

**Wave 2a (2026-10-06)** changed files again on rulings T1 and again ran no docker step that changes
state: see "Wave 2" at the end. The numbered list there replaces the draft lines wave 1 kept in this
file, and the sections below are wave 1's record as written.

**Wave 2b (2026-10-06)** did ruling U2 (the port check, the header, the bb2dash-stack wording, the
list's four corrections) and then began the docker step. **The image did not build**: steps 1 to 9
of the list passed, and step 10 failed because the embedding model's download address now answers
403. No container was started; tasks 12 and 13 are still owed from step 10 on. See "Wave 2b" at the
end.

**Review round (2026-10-06)** did ruling V2, files only: the image holds one pinned CA at
`/app/certs/prod-ca.crt` and the service names it in `WORKSPACE_DB_CA_FILE`; `/app/turn` is root's
and 0555; the list gained three checks and is renumbered 1 to 41. No build and no container: every
check that needs the image is still owed from step 10 on. See "Review round" at the end.

**Docker step, second run (2026-10-07)**: the image builds (the harness is on `fastembed` 2.1.1) and
steps 1 to 40 of the list pass on it, the token smoke among them. The firewall met a real kernel for
the first time and raised; one count was wrong (a resolver that repeats its answer), fixed
test-first in one round and rebuilt. Tasks 12 and 13 are done as far as this stream's checks go. The
test container is left up and healthy for the PM's walk; step 41 is not run. See the last section.

## The guard (read before and after everything this stream did)

## Task 12 — image, entrypoint, firewall, the `workspace` service

Commits on `feat/workspace-21-container`: `ebbc5ce` (the test, red), `4435aa1` (the five files under
`docker/workspace/`), `e3e93d9` (the compose block), then this file and one follow-up to the firewall
(the set type, below).

### RED: the test before the files

```
node --test docker/grep-clean.test.mjs          (at ebbc5ce: no docker/workspace/ yet)
✖ the build contexts are the ones compose.yaml builds from
✖ an image is read through <Dockerfile>.dockerignore when it has one, else its context's .dockerignore
✖ the workspace image has its own allow-list, and the root .dockerignore does not name it
  Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '…\docker\workspace\Dockerfile.dockerignore'
✖ the workspace Dockerfile pins the CLI, builds the materials server in a stage and copies named paths only
  Error: ENOENT: no such file or directory, open '…\docker\workspace\Dockerfile'
✖ workspace: what docker/workspace/Dockerfile copies is clean
ℹ tests 11
ℹ pass 6
ℹ fail 5
```

At the cut the file had 6 tests, all passing. The change adds the `workspace` entry to `IMAGES`, reads
`<Dockerfile>.dockerignore` when one exists, and adds four tests (a named-context `COPY` is skipped;
which ignore file each image reads; the allow-list is the Contract's nine lines and the root
`.dockerignore` does not name `workspace`; the Dockerfile pins `2.1.289`, never names
`CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION=latest` or `bb2dash-mcp:local`, and copies exactly six named paths from
`workspace/`).

### After the files: 10 of 11 in this tree, and why not 11

```
node --test docker/grep-clean.test.mjs          (wave 1 tree, e3e93d9)
✔ … (10 tests)
✖ workspace: what docker/workspace/Dockerfile copies is clean
  AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: docker/workspace/Dockerfile copies workspace/package.json, which is not in .
ℹ tests 11
ℹ pass 10
ℹ fail 1
```

**This is not green, and cannot be in wave 1.** The Dockerfile copies `workspace/package.json`,
`package-lock.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src/`, `claude/` and `prompts/`, and `workspace/` is W-64's
package: it reaches this branch only by merge (task loop 4c). The test refuses a `COPY` source that does
not exist, which is the right refusal, so it was not loosened. The row's check (a) is owed in wave 2,
after the merge.

To show the test will pass once the files are there, and that it then really reads them, the same test
file was run in a scratch copy of this tree (`git archive HEAD docker compose.yaml .dockerignore sync
ingest desktop/src/core/sync-id.ts mcp-server`, outside every repo) with stub files at the six paths,
plus a `workspace/README.md` and a `workspace/test/fixtures/` file that each name a `C:` path:

```
node --test docker/grep-clean.test.mjs          (scratch copy with stub workspace/ files)
✔ workspace: what docker/workspace/Dockerfile copies is clean
ℹ workspace: 24 file(s) scanned of 24 copied
ℹ tests 11
ℹ pass 11
ℹ fail 0
```

The README and the fixture were not scanned (named paths, never the folder whole). With one more stub,
`workspace/src/planted.ts` holding `const dir = 'C:/Users/someone/projects';`, the same run fails with
`workspace/src/planted.ts: a C:/ drive path`. A stub is not W-64's code: this says nothing about whether
the real package is clean.

### Check (d), the parts that need no container

```
grep -c -E "CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION=latest|bb2dash-mcp:local" docker/workspace/Dockerfile        → 0
bash -n docker/workspace/entrypoint.sh  docker/workspace/init-firewall.sh  docker/workspace/mcp-rag.sh   → each ok
```

`shellcheck` is not installed on stack-laptop, so it was not run. All five new files and the two
changed ones hold no carriage return (`grep -c $'\r'` → 0 for each).

In a shell with only the Windows user variables set (`SECRETS_DIR` and `BB2DASH_DIR` set; `HARNESS_DIR`
and `COMPOSE_PROFILES` unset, read with `env`), from `bb2dash-wt-21-container`:

```
docker compose -f compose.yaml config --quiet; echo $?                        → 0
docker compose -f compose.yaml config --services                              → sync
docker compose -f compose.yaml --profile workspace config --services          → sync, workspace
docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace config --format json | node -e "let s='';process.stdin.on('data',d=>s+=d).on('end',()=>{const w=JSON.parse(s).services.workspace;console.log([w.ports===undefined,w.init,w.platform,Object.keys(w.networks).join(),w.profiles.join(),w.stop_grace_period].join(' '))})"
                                                                              → true true linux/amd64 workspace-net workspace 30s
```

With no profile the rendered project holds one service (`sync`), one network (`default`), two volumes
(`bb-profile`, `course-files`) and `sync`'s four secrets: the Workspace's network, volume and three new
secret entries are not in it at all. So what the desktop's sign-in task sees
(`docker compose -f <repo>/compose.yaml up -d --wait`, `desktop/launch/logon-build.ps1` line 429) is
unchanged. The main checkout's own `.env` sets neither `COMPOSE_PROFILES` nor `HARNESS_DIR` (the two
names were counted with `grep -c`; no value was read).

Rendered under `-p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace`: network `bb2dash-wt21_workspace-net`, volume
`bb2dash-wt21_workspace-claude-home`, the four secrets at `/run/secrets/<name>`, environment exactly
`CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/home/node/.claude`, `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1`,
`ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=false`, `WORKSPACE_TURN_BUDGET_USD=1.00`, healthcheck
`node /app/workspace/dist/healthcheck.js` 30s / 5s / 3 / 1m0s, `cap_add` NET_ADMIN and NET_RAW,
`no-new-privileges:true`, `restart: unless-stopped`, no `ports`, no `user`, no `DATABASE_URL`.

A `--profile` flag replaces `COMPOSE_PROFILES` for that command (read here:
`COMPOSE_PROFILES=workspace docker compose -f compose.yaml --profile mcp config --services` → `bb2dash-mcp`,
`sync`). So `just dev` (`--profile dev run …`) does not start the Workspace once `.env` holds the line.

### The compose edit does not change the live `sync` service

```
docker compose -f compose.yaml config --hash sync
```

| where | output |
|---|---|
| `C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash` (`main`, 06e046b) | `sync 448f155ac0209cc0a233a9d09653fd02ebb3eda51fc84ec02ff9a5341ac7e6e7` |
| `bb2dash-wt-21-container` before the edit | the same |
| `bb2dash-wt-21-container` after the edit (e3e93d9) | the same |
| the live container's own label, `docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "com.docker.compose.config-hash" }}' bb2dash-sync-1` | `448f155ac0209cc0a233a9d09653fd02ebb3eda51fc84ec02ff9a5341ac7e6e7` |

The hash the edited file renders for `sync` is the hash the running container was created with, so an
`up` from the merged file does not recreate it. `git diff 06e046b -- compose.yaml` is additions only: the
`workspace` service block, one line under `volumes:`, the `networks:` block and three entries under
`secrets:`.

### The firewall: what was chosen where the brief does not spell it out

`docker/workspace/init-firewall.sh` follows the Contract's keep and drop lists. It has **no running
check in wave 1**; the list below is every place a choice had to be made, for the PM and the security
review to rule on.

(Ruled on 2026-10-06, T1: choices 2, 3 and 5 are kept; choice 4 became a port rule in wave 2, and
the read behind choice 5 was fixed. The list below is wave 1's wording.)

1. **Order: resolve first, then default deny.** As in the dev firewall, the four names are resolved
   while the OUTPUT policy is still ACCEPT, because Docker's embedded resolver may forward upstream from
   inside this container's network namespace. Only the root script is running in that window.
2. **Every A record of the one answer is allowed and pinned**, not only the first. The Contract says
   "adds that address"; an answer with two addresses (the Supabase project's name has two today) gets two
   set entries and two `/etc/hosts` lines.
3. **An answer that is not a public IPv4 address is refused** (loopback, 10/8, 172.16/12, 192.168/16,
   100.64/10, 169.254/16, 0/8, 224/4 and up). Not in the brief. Without it a wrong DNS answer could put
   the Docker host or the home network on the allowlist, which is what dropping the /24 rule is for.
4. **No port rule.** The set holds addresses; any port on an allowed address is allowed, as in the dev
   firewall. Tightening to tcp/443 (the two HTTPS names) and tcp/5432 (the poolers) is possible and was
   not done, because the Contract lists hosts, not ports.
5. **IPv6 when `ip6tables` cannot set its rules.** The dev script fails only on a *global* address. This
   one fails on any IPv6 address off loopback (link-local reaches the Docker host), read from
   `/proc/net/if_inet6`, and passes when that file is absent or lists only `lo`. On stack-laptop
   `ip6tables` worked for the dev container (100_W58: "IPv6 closed (loopback only)").
6. **The DSN host is read with a URL's rules**: the authority ends at the first `/`, `?` or `#`, the
   user part at its last `@`, the port is dropped, the name is lower-cased and must match whole labels
   ending `.pooler.supabase.com`. A bracketed address, an IPv4 address, a trailing dot, an underscore
   and a password holding an unencoded `/` all stop the start. A refusal prints the secret's *name* and
   a fixed sentence, never any part of the value.
7. **A missing or empty DSN secret stops the start** (the Contract says "anything else fails closed").
   So the container cannot start until `workspace_runner_db_url` exists (task 19's first half).
8. **What is printed.** The two fixed names, each resolver address, each pooler *host name* once it has
   passed the suffix rule, and a count of addresses. No address of an allowed host, no user name, no
   password, no path or query of a DSN.
9. **Pins are lines ending `# pinned by init-firewall.sh`**; a start first removes the lines an earlier
   start left, and rewrites `/etc/hosts` in place (it is a mounted file and cannot be replaced).
10. **The script sets its own `PATH` and `HOME`** and calls `curl -q` and `dig -r`. The image's `PATH`
    ends in the npm prefix `node` owns, and curl and dig read dot-files from `HOME`: "reads nothing
    `node` can write" needed all four.
11. **Exit codes:** 75 for a refused second run (the dev script's), 1 for a failed start, the failing
    command's own code otherwise; a start that ends early is never reported as 0.
12. **The set type is `hash:net`**, the dev firewall's, although only single addresses are added:
    `hash:net` is known to work under Docker Desktop on this laptop (100_W58), `hash:ip` is not.
13. **Where the scripts live in the image:** `/app/docker/workspace/entrypoint.sh` and
    `/app/docker/workspace/init-firewall.sh`, root-owned, mode 0755 (the sync image keeps its entrypoint
    at the same kind of path).

Outside the firewall, three smaller choices:

* **`entrypoint.sh` removes `/run/workspace` before it makes it**, so a heartbeat file left by the last
  run cannot read as a live runner; and it exports `HOME`, `USER` and `LOGNAME` for `node` before
  `setpriv` (which changes ids, not the environment).
* **`mcp-rag.sh` has every path fixed** (the dev launcher takes two from the environment), and checks
  that the CA, the server and the model folder exist before it starts the server.
* **The Dockerfile assumes `workspace/package.json` has a `build` script that writes `dist/` from
  `src/`** (`npm ci`, `npm run build`, `npm prune --omit=dev`, the steps the other two packages use).
  The brief freezes the output paths, not the script's name: see "Questions for the PM".

### The firewall's logic, dry-run against fake tools (not a kernel)

The script was run under Git Bash from a scratch folder with its six path constants and its `PATH` line
rewritten by `sed` to scratch paths, against fake `iptables`, `ip6tables`, `iptables-save`, `ipset`, `dig`
and `curl` that log their arguments. This proves the script's own control flow. It proves nothing about
netfilter, Docker's DNS or the real hosts.

| case | exit (want) | left at deny-all | note |
|---|---|---|---|
| A happy path: three names, both DSNs on one pooler | 0 (0) | no | 3 lookups, 4 pins |
| B a second run in the same container | 75 (75) | no | 0 new calls to any tool |
| C a DSN host that is not a pooler | 1 (1) | yes | 0 `ipset create`; 0 lines of output holding the password, the user or the host |
| C2 an unencoded `/` in a password | 1 (1) | yes | nothing of the value printed |
| C3 a secret file missing | 1 (1) | yes | `harness_database_url: the secret file is missing or not readable` |
| C4 a secret file holding only a BOM and CRLF | 1 (1) | yes | `workspace_runner_db_url: the secret file is empty` |
| D a name that does not resolve | 1 (1) | yes | |
| E `example.com` reachable at the end check | 1 (1) | yes | |
| F `api.anthropic.com` unreachable at the end check | 1 (1) | yes | |
| G1 no `ip6tables`, a link-local address on `eth0` | 1 (1) | yes | |
| G2 no `ip6tables`, loopback only | 0 (0) | no | |
| G3 no `ip6tables`, no IPv6 in the kernel | 0 (0) | no | |
| H a private answer for an allowed name | 1 (1) | yes | 0 `ipset add` of it |
| H2 private, public and junk answers together | 0 (0) | no | only the public one added |
| I a stale pin from an earlier start | 0 (0) | no | the stale line is gone, `localhost` kept |
| J the set rule cannot be added | 4 (4) | yes | |
| K two different pooler names | 0 (0) | no | 4 lookups, 4 names |

The happy path's calls, in order (case A; the two `DOCKER_*` lines are the fake's stand-in for Docker's
DNS redirect):

```

```

`dsn_host` on its own, read into a shell from the script (the script runs `main` only when executed):
23 of 23 URL shapes as wanted. Allowed: the session-pooler form with its query string, an upper-case
host (lower-cased), an upper-case scheme, `%40` in the password, a raw `@` in the password, no user
part. Refused: `evilpooler.supabase.com`, `<pooler>.evil.example`, bare `pooler.supabase.com`,
`db.<ref>.supabase.co`, `[2001:db8::1]`, an IPv4 address, a trailing dot, an underscore label, a label
starting with a hyphen, the pooler name placed after a `/`, a `?` or a `#` of another host, a
backslash-`@` form, `mysql://`, a bare host name, a space before the host. No refusal printed any part
of the value. `is_public_ipv4`: 21 of 21 (8 public, 13 internal, including 172.15/172.32 and
100.63/100.128 at the edges).

The two clauses the security review is asked to read (IPv6 closed; a DSN host that does not end
`.pooler.supabase.com` fails closed) are step 6 and step 1 of `main`, and cases G1–G3 and C, C2 above.

### The paste-ready lines, and task 13

Wave 1 kept a draft of the docker lines for tasks 12 and 13 here (in git at `09b5c4a`). Rulings T1
changed how they must be written, so they were rewritten in wave 2: see "Wave 2 — the lines for tasks
12 and 13, top to bottom" at the end of this file. Task 13 has nothing to show before the image exists.

## Task 14 — bb2dash-stack: the secret name, the profile, the doctor row, the README

Commits on bb2dash-stack `feat/workspace-21`: `5d519d2` (the tests, red), `e371752` (the code). Cut from
`origin/main` eb71e8b.

### RED

```
node --test doctor/workspace.test.mjs doctor/doctor.test.mjs          (at 5d519d2)
✖ the all-green fixture exits 0 and prints every row
✖ secrets.example/ and compose.yaml name exactly the 12 frozen secrets
SyntaxError: The requested module './lib/constants.mjs' does not provide an export named 'WORKSPACE_PROFILE'
✖ doctor\workspace.test.mjs
ℹ tests 32
ℹ pass 29
ℹ fail 3
```

### GREEN (check (a))

```
node --test doctor/workspace.test.mjs doctor/doctor.test.mjs          (at e371752)
ℹ tests 46
ℹ suites 0
ℹ pass 46
ℹ fail 0
```

`doctor/workspace.test.mjs` (15 tests): `SECRET_NAMES`, `secrets.example/` and the umbrella `compose.yaml`
name the same twelve; `ALL_PROFILES` holds `workspace` and the ports check passes `--profile workspace`;
with every row green the doctor exits 0 and the row reads `running, healthy`; it exits 1, with exactly
one problem row, when `workspace_runner_db_url` is missing, empty or only a BOM and a newline (`secrets`),
and when the service has no container, is `exited`, `restarting`, `created`, `paused` or `dead`, is
running but `unhealthy`, still `starting` or has no health status, or compose fails or prints something
that is not JSON (`workspace`); the row runs one command,
`docker compose --profile workspace ps --all --format json workspace`, and the doctor runs no command
that changes anything; `.env.example`, the README section and tables, and no file still counting 11.
The three other test files that read `compose.yaml`, `.env.example` or the README
(`scripts/dev-isolation.test.mjs`, `scripts/devcontainer.test.mjs`, `scripts/open-login.test.mjs`) →
32 of 32.

### Check (d)

| check | result | at the cut (eb71e8b) |
|---|---|---|
| `git ls-files secrets.example \| wc -l` | 12 | 11 |
| `grep -c "^COMPOSE_PROFILES=workspace" .env.example` | 1 | 0 |
| `grep -cE "11 (files\|names\|frozen names)" README.md compose.yaml` | 0 and 0 | 3 and 2 |
| `grep -c "all 11" doctor/lib/checks-host.mjs` | 0 | 1 |
| `grep -c "docker compose restart workspace" README.md` | 1 | 0 |
| `grep -c "workspace_runner_db_url" README.md` | 2 | 0 |
| `grep -c "workspace-claude-home" README.md` | 3 | 0 |
| `git diff --stat origin/main...HEAD -- doctor/doctor.mjs` | prints nothing | |

`secrets.example/workspace_runner_db_url` is 0 bytes. The secrets folder itself was listed by name and
size only: on 2026-10-05 it holds the three shared names (`claude_oauth_token`, `bb2dash_mcp_service_key`,
`harness_database_url`) and not yet `workspace_runner_db_url` (task 19's first half is Stack's).

### What the row does, in words

The row is a problem whenever the `workspace` container is not running and healthy, with or without the
profile in `.env` (the task's check asks for that). So between the merge and acceptance step 13, when
Stack adds `COMPOSE_PROFILES=workspace` and runs `just up`, `just doctor` shows
`workspace  not running: no container (set COMPOSE_PROFILES=workspace in .env, then just up)`.

(Changed in wave 2 by ruling T1: with the profile off the row now reads `off` and is not a problem.
See "Task 14, wave 2".)

Two things beyond the row's list in the Files table, both small: the README's "What runs" table and its
volumes line name the service and `workspace-claude-home`, and the umbrella `compose.yaml`'s header
comment lists the service and the volume beside the line that said 11.

## Questions for the PM (wave 1; answered by rulings T1 on 2026-10-06)

1. **`npm run build` in `workspace/`.** The Dockerfile's runner stage runs `npm ci`, `npm run build`,
   `npm prune --omit=dev` and copies `/build/dist`. The Contract freezes `dist/runner.js`,
   `dist/healthcheck.js` and `dist/hooks/tool-gate.js`, not the script that makes them. If W-64's
   package builds under another script name or to another folder, one line of the Dockerfile changes.
   Wave 2's step 0 has a line that reads it.
2. **`grep-clean` cannot be 11 of 11 before the merge** (above). The row's check (a) is owed in wave 2.
3. **The firewall's choices 2, 3, 4 and 5** go beyond or beside the Contract's words (all addresses of
   one answer; non-public answers refused; no port rule; the stricter IPv6 fallback). Each is one small
   edit to reverse.
4. **`workspace_runner_db_url` must exist before `up`**: compose refuses to start a service whose
   secret file is missing, and the firewall refuses an empty one. Task 12's order already says so.

## Wave 2 (2026-10-06) — rulings T1, files and read-only checks only

Wave 2a is every item of ruling T1 and nothing that changes docker state. **No `docker build`, `up`,
`run`, `exec`, `stop`, `rm`, `restart` or `create` was run by this stream, no `just` verb and no
`claude -p`.** The image is still unbuilt: nothing here proves that it builds, or that the firewall
works in a kernel. The build and every container check are the next step, with the PM, and are
written out below as one numbered list.

First step of the wave: `git fetch origin`, then `git merge origin/feat/workspace-21` into
`feat/workspace-21-container` (no conflict; W-64's `workspace/` arrived with it), pushed as `ec302ce`.
The phase branch gained one docs commit during the wave (`4ca39d9`); it was merged the same way
(`2fccee8`). bb2dash-stack needed no merge.

| T1 item | what changed | where | red → green |
|---|---|---|---|
| (a) every A record allowed and pinned | kept | `init-firewall.sh` | a test now holds it |
| (b) non-public answers refused | kept | `init-firewall.sh` | a test now holds it |
| (c) the port rule | two sets, each with one port: tcp/443 for the two HTTPS names, tcp/5432 for the poolers | `init-firewall.sh` | `17e2cfd` → `9a9bb85` |
| (d) IPv6 when ip6tables cannot set rules | kept; the read no longer pipes into `grep -q` under pipefail | `init-firewall.sh` | `17e2cfd` → `9a9bb85` |
| the pin cannot move by itself | `DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1` in the service; the CLI's folder is root's after the install | `compose.yaml`, `Dockerfile` | `6be6de3` → `c572a3a` |
| no `iproute2` | removed: no script calls `ip` | `Dockerfile` | `6be6de3` → `c572a3a` |
| the runner stage against W-64's real package | confirmed, and now asserted | `docker/grep-clean.test.mjs` | passes as written |
| grep-clean 11 of 11 after the merge | 11 of 11 | | below |
| literal-address probes, the restart line, the `pgrep` line, variables inside each line | written | the numbered list below | not run (docker) |
| the doctor's Workspace row | off is not a problem; on, the container and the secret both count | bb2dash-stack | `496220e` → `6255923` |
| the README's `secrets/` wording | corrected to `SECRETS_DIR` | bb2dash-stack | `496220e` → `6255923` |

### grep-clean, 11 of 11 with the real `workspace/` in the tree (task 12 check (a))

Right after the merge, before any edit of wave 2 (`ec302ce`):

```text
node --test docker/grep-clean.test.mjs
✔ every pattern catches its planted line (a pattern that matches nothing guards nothing)
✔ comments are stripped, code is kept

✔ workspace: what docker/workspace/Dockerfile copies is clean
ℹ workspace: 41 file(s) scanned of 41 copied
ℹ tests 11
ℹ pass 11
ℹ fail 0
```

The eleventh test, red in wave 1 for want of the package, reads W-64's real files now: 41 files copied,
41 scanned, no Windows drive path, `.ps1`, PowerShell, `Move-Item` or OneDrive outside a comment. The
count is still 11 at the end of the wave: wave 2's new assertions sit inside the Dockerfile test.

### The firewall: the port rule and the IPv6 read

**The dry run is now a committed test**, `docker/workspace/init-firewall.test.mjs` (wave 1 ran it from a
scratch folder). It copies the script with its five place constants and its PATH line pointed at a
scratch folder, runs it with a real bash against fake `iptables`, `ip6tables`, `iptables-save`, `ipset`,
`dig` and `curl` that log their arguments, and reads the log back. New in wave 2: a small model of the
OUTPUT chain built from that log, so a test can ask what a new connection to a literal address and
port would meet. It proves the script's own logic. It proves nothing about netfilter, Docker's resolver
or the real hosts. The image does not copy it (the Dockerfile copies named files only), and it is one
file beyond the brief's Files table: see "Questions for the PM".

RED, the test before the code (`17e2cfd`, the wave 1 script):

```text
node --test docker/workspace/init-firewall.test.mjs
✖ the port rule (T1 c): tcp/443 to the two HTTPS names, tcp/5432 to the pooler, and no rule without a port
    +   '-m set --match-set workspace-allowed dst -j ACCEPT',
    -   '-p tcp --dport 443 -m set --match-set workspace-https dst -j ACCEPT',
    -   '-p tcp --dport 5432 -m set --match-set workspace-postgres dst -j ACCEPT',
✖ by literal address: an allowed address answers on its own port only, and no other address on any
    AssertionError: 160.79.104.10 tcp/80        actual: 'open'   expected: 'blocked'
✖ IPv6: a long list of addresses off loopback still stops the start (the read is not a pipe that can break)
    actual: 0   expected: 1        (its log ends "Firewall raised: 3 name(s) allowed")
✖ no pipe in the script feeds a reader that stops early (under pipefail a broken pipe reads as a failure)
    + [ `elif awk '$NF != "lo"' "$INET6_ADDRESSES" | grep -q .; then` ]
✖ an answer that is not a public IPv4 address is never allowed (T1 b)        (the set it must land in is not made yet)
✖ a rule that cannot be added stops the start at deny-all with the failing command's own code
✖ two database secrets on two poolers: both are allowed on 5432, neither on 443
ℹ tests 18
ℹ pass 11
ℹ fail 7
```

The third line is a real fault of the wave 1 script, not only a style point: with `ip6tables`
unavailable and 20,000 IPv6 addresses off loopback, `awk … | grep -q .` under `pipefail` failed as a
pipeline (the reader stopped at the first line and broke the writer's pipe), the `elif` read that as
"none found", and the start went on with IPv6 open. A short list did not show it, which is why wave
1's cases G1 to G3 passed.

GREEN (`9a9bb85`):

```text
node --test docker/workspace/init-firewall.test.mjs
▶ docker/workspace/init-firewall.sh, dry run against fake tools
  ✔ a start that works: one lookup a name, every address pinned, nothing of a connection string printed

  ✔ by literal address: an allowed address answers on its own port only, and no other address on any

  ✔ is_public_ipv4: loopback, private, carrier-grade NAT, link-local, multicast and reserved are not public
ℹ tests 18
ℹ pass 18
ℹ fail 0
```

About 40 seconds on stack-laptop. Every wave 1 property has its test: one run per start (a second run
exits 75 and calls no tool), deny-all on any failure before the last check (asserted on the modelled
chain: policy DROP, one loopback rule, four addresses blocked), DNS only to resolv.conf's resolvers,
no accept for the Docker network (the gateway and the Docker host are blocked on 6080, 443, 5432 and
80), and a connection string never echoed (no password, no user and no `postgres://…` in any log,
and no part of a refused URL in a refusal).

The happy path's calls, in order (the fakes' log; the addresses are the test's):

```text

```

What the model reads off those rules (the test "by literal address"): the three HTTPS addresses are
open on tcp/443 and blocked on 80, 5432 and 8443; the pooler address is open on tcp/5432 and blocked
on 443 and 6543; UDP to any of them is blocked; `1.1.1.1` is blocked on 443, on 5432 and on udp/53.

Choices made in wave 2, for the PM and the security review:

1. **Two sets of the proven type, each with its own rule**, not one `hash:ip,port` set: `hash:net` is
   the type the dev firewall proved under Docker Desktop on this laptop.
2. **Which set a name goes into is fixed by where the name comes from**: the two names in the script
   go to tcp/443, the host of each database secret to tcp/5432. A DSN's own port is not read.
3. **A DSN whose port is not 5432 is not refused by the firewall.** The container starts, and that
   connection is then refused by the port rule (the runner's own config already refuses 6543 for
   `workspace_runner_db_url`; for `harness_database_url` the rag server would fail to connect). On
   2026-10-06 both secrets name port 5432 (102a, task 19). See "Questions for the PM".
4. **The script's constant `ALLOWED_HOSTS` is now `HTTPS_HOSTS`.** If the token smoke fails on the
   network, the missing host goes there (tcp/443), into 102a and into a DECISIONS row.
5. **The end check is unchanged** (`example.com` refused, `api.anthropic.com` answered). After default
   deny an unpinned name cannot be looked up from inside the container, so `example.com` fails there
   on the lookup; the literal-address probes of the list below are what prove the address rule.
6. **The log line per name now says the port**: `Allowed <name> on tcp/<port> (<n> address(es), pinned
   in /etc/hosts)`.

`bash -n` passes on `entrypoint.sh`, `init-firewall.sh` and `mcp-rag.sh`; none of the changed files
holds a carriage return.

### The image: a CLI that cannot move under its pin, and no `iproute2`

RED (`6be6de3`, the wave 1 Dockerfile and compose file):

```text
node --test docker/grep-clean.test.mjs
✖ the workspace Dockerfile pins the CLI, builds the materials server in a stage and copies named paths only
    + [
    +   'after the CLI install its folder is not handed to root (chown -R root:root /usr/local/share/npm-global)',
    +   'compose.yaml does not set DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1 for the workspace service'
    + ]
    - []
ℹ tests 11
ℹ pass 10
ℹ fail 1
```

The test reads three rules; the first failure stops it, so the three were also printed on their own:
`pinDrift` the two lines above, `unusedPackages` → `iproute2 is installed and no script in the image
calls ip`, `runnerStageMismatches` → `[]`.

GREEN (`c572a3a`): `tests 11`, `pass 11`, `fail 0`.

* **`DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER: "1"`** is in the service's `environment:`. The runner hands its whole
  environment to the CLI (`workspace/src/providers/claude-cli.ts`, `childEnv`), so the setting reaches
  every turn. The block still interpolates nothing outside `build:`, the secret paths and
  `WORKSPACE_TURN_BUDGET_USD`.
* **The CLI's folder is root's**: `chown -R root:root /usr/local/share/npm-global` runs after the
  install. **It runs in a stage of its own (`cli`), and the runtime stage copies the folder**
  (`COPY --from=cli`). The reason is the package itself, read from the registry and from its tarball:
  `@anthropic-ai/claude-code@2.1.289` is a 187 kB wrapper whose `postinstall` hard-links the
  platform binary (`@anthropic-ai/claude-code-linux-x64`, 246 MB unpacked) onto `bin/claude.exe`. A
  `chown -R` in a later layer of the runtime stage changes every file's owner, so that layer would
  store the binary again (this is reasoning about image layers, not a measurement: nothing was built).
  In a stage the install keeps the dev container's recipe to the letter (`USER node`,
  `NPM_CONFIG_PREFIX=/usr/local/share/npm-global`, `npm install -g "@anthropic-ai/claude-code@${CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION}"`),
  the chown is the ruling's command, and the image carries the folder once. Not asked for in those
  words: see "Questions for the PM". Whether the CLI must write there is the token smoke's to show
  (step 27 of the list); if it must, the fix is `--chown=node:node` on the one COPY line.
* **No `iproute2`**: no script in the image calls `ip` (the firewall reads the container's IPv6
  addresses from `/proc/net/if_inet6`). The comment says so, and the test fails if a script starts
  calling `ip` without the package, or the package comes back without a caller.
* **The runner stage matches W-64's package as merged**: `workspace/package.json` has
  `"build": "tsc -p tsconfig.json"`, `workspace/tsconfig.json` builds `src` into `dist`, and
  `src/runner.ts`, `src/healthcheck.ts`, `src/hooks/tool-gate.ts`, `claude/settings.json` and
  `prompts/system.md` are in the package; the six COPY paths are the six the test pins
  (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`, `tsconfig.json`, `src`, `claude`, `prompts`); the image's
  `CMD` is `node /app/workspace/dist/runner.js`, the service's healthcheck is
  `node /app/workspace/dist/healthcheck.js`, and the hook `settings.json` wires is
  `node /app/workspace/dist/hooks/tool-gate.js`. The runner's own path constants
  (`workspace/src/config.ts`) name `/app/workspace/claude/settings.json`,
  `/app/workspace/prompts/system.md`, `/app/turn`, `/run/workspace` and the two secret paths, as the
  image lays them out. All of it is now asserted by the Dockerfile test.

### Checks run in wave 2 (read-only docker only)

From `bb2dash-wt-21-container`, at the wave's last commit:

```text

```

Compose, with `HARNESS_DIR` and `COMPOSE_PROFILES` unset and the two Windows user variables as they
are on stack-laptop (`SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets`,
`BB2DASH_DIR=C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash`):

```

The `sync` service is unchanged by this branch:

| where | `docker compose -f compose.yaml config --hash sync` |
|---|---|
| `C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash` (`main`) | `sync 448f155ac0209cc0a233a9d09653fd02ebb3eda51fc84ec02ff9a5341ac7e6e7` |
| `bb2dash-wt-21-container` at the wave's last commit | the same |
| the live container's label (`com.docker.compose.config-hash`) | `448f155ac0209cc0a233a9d09653fd02ebb3eda51fc84ec02ff9a5341ac7e6e7` |

The rendered `sync` service itself (its whole JSON without `build`, with its four secrets and two
volumes) is byte-identical between the two checkouts: 1845 bytes each. `git diff origin/main --
compose.yaml` is 90 added lines and no removed line.

Read on the host, for the list's literal-address probes: `1.1.1.1:443`, `api.anthropic.com:80`,
`goultdzqcavefcgnifdy.supabase.co:80` and the pooler's `6543` each accept a TCP connection from this
laptop (2026-10-06). So `blocked` for them inside the container is the firewall's doing.

The four secret files the service mounts exist and are not empty (sizes only were read;
`workspace_runner_db_url` is the 169 bytes 102a records). The harness checkout is at
`e7997f3e3ddc402a3c8f535d3b926bbd61d6adbd` with nothing uncommitted under `mcp-server` or `certs`;
`alpine:3.20` and `ghcr.io/gitleaks/gitleaks:v8.30.1` are on the laptop; no `bb2dash-workspace:local`
image and no container of project `bb2dash-wt21` exists.

**Not yet true, by design:** `git merge-base --is-ancestor feat/workspace-21-runner HEAD; echo $?`
read `1` during the wave, because W-64's wave 2 commits are on the runner branch and not yet on the
phase branch. Step 2 of the list merges again and re-reads it; the build waits for `0`.

### Task 14, wave 2 — the doctor's row follows the profile; the README names `SECRETS_DIR`

RED (bb2dash-stack `496220e`):

```text
node --test doctor/workspace.test.mjs doctor/doctor.test.mjs
✖ a missing workspace_runner_db_url exits 1 and is named, by the secrets row and by the workspace row
✖ an empty workspace_runner_db_url exits 1, and one holding only a BOM and a newline counts as empty
✖ with the profile off in .env the workspace row reads off and is not a problem, whatever Docker would say
✖ off says how to turn the Workspace on, and its secret stays the secrets row's to name
✖ with the profile on, the row is a problem unless the container is running and healthy and the secret is non-empty
✖ the profile is read as compose reads it: a list, the environment over .env, and * for every profile
✖ no workspace container exits 1 and says how to start it
✖ the README has a Workspace section that says what it is, what it costs, how to restart it and where an answer is kept
✖ the README tables name the Workspace: its secret, the three it shares, the doctor row and what runs
✖ the README says the secrets live in the folder SECRETS_DIR names, outside every repo, never in a secrets/ folder here
ℹ tests 51
ℹ pass 41
ℹ fail 10
```

GREEN (bb2dash-stack `6255923`): `tests 51`, `pass 51`, `fail 0` (46 in wave 1). The three other
test files that read `compose.yaml`, `.env.example` or the README: 32 of 32. Task 14's check (d)
reads as in wave 1, with `grep -c "workspace_runner_db_url" README.md` now 3; `git diff --stat
origin/main...HEAD -- doctor/doctor.mjs` still prints nothing.

The row, in words:

* **Profile off** (`COMPOSE_PROFILES` does not name `workspace`; read from `.env` with the process
  environment on top, as compose reads it, a comma-separated list where `*` means every profile):
  the row reads `off (COMPOSE_PROFILES in .env does not name workspace; to turn it on:
  COMPOSE_PROFILES=workspace in .env, then just up)`, asks Docker nothing and is not a problem,
  whatever state a container is in.
* **Profile on**: a problem unless the container is running and healthy **and**
  `workspace_runner_db_url` is non-empty. A missing or empty secret is named in the row beside
  Docker's answer (`running, healthy; workspace_runner_db_url is missing in SECRETS_DIR (…)`), never
  its value. The `secrets` row names it too, as before, so that case now lists two problem rows.
* The `secrets` row is unchanged: it still wants all 12 files whatever the profiles say (see
  "Questions for the PM").

The README: every place that put the secrets in this repo's `secrets/` folder now says the folder
`SECRETS_DIR` names, outside every repo (the intro, the layout, "First time on a machine", "Secrets",
the note under the verbs, the dev container's mounts, "Stack's machine steps"); the Workspace section
says the container reaches the two HTTPS names on port 443 and the pooler on 5432; the doctor table's
row says what off means; and the cost sentence is whole on one line: "costs nothing extra only while
Usage credits are off on the Claude account".

## Wave 2 — the lines for tasks 12 and 13, top to bottom (Git Bash)

**Every line is a Git Bash line and stands alone.** It changes into the worktree itself, sets
`SECRETS_DIR` and `HARNESS_DIR` itself (never a separate `export`), and carries `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`
wherever docker is handed a container path, so Git Bash rewrites nothing. The project is
`bb2dash-wt21` and the service is named in every compose command. Every `exec` has `-T` (no
pseudo-terminal: the line then behaves the same pasted into a terminal and run by a tool). Never
`just up`, never an `up` without the service name. To run the list in another tree (tasks 19 to 22
run in `bb2dash-wt-21`), change the one folder name after `cd`.

(Wave 2b ran steps 1 to 10 against docker on 2026-10-06, with the list as it then was; step 10
failed, and every step after it is still unrun. The review round then changed the list for ruling
V2 and renumbered it: steps 23 and 32 are new, the token smoke (now step 28) runs from `/app/turn`,
steps 3, 4, 7, 19, 20 and 22 read the new literals, and what was 23 to 39 is now 24 to 41. The
table of old and new numbers is under "Review round", at the end. Sections of this file written
before the review round name the numbers they were written with. The paragraph below is wave 2a's,
as written then.)

(The docker step's second run, 2026-10-07, ran steps 1 to 40 against docker; step 41 was left unrun
on purpose, so the container stays up for the PM's walk. Its outputs are in the last section of this
file. The list was corrected in place that day at seven steps, and each says so where it stands:
step 3's firewall count is 21, step 9's commit, the address counts of steps 14, 25, 29 and 34, and
one new line in step 27 for the embedding model's new host.)

**None of these lines has been run against docker.** Their quoting has: each docker line was read
back out of this file in Git Bash and run with `docker` standing for a program that starts nothing
and records what it was handed (a native Windows program, so Git Bash treats its arguments as it
would docker's), from a shell with `SECRETS_DIR`, `HARNESS_DIR` and `COMPOSE_PROFILES` unset. The
result is under the list.

Read the guard (step 1) again after every step marked **(guard)**, and paste it into 102a.

**1.** The guard.

```
docker inspect -f '{{.Id}} {{.State.StartedAt}}' bb2dash-sync-1
```
→ `bd4d4ae8bb716c53141fcae699d3872dd72c44622674209ed496d04d28305f02 2026-10-05T22:06:22.891074981Z`

**2.** The tree holds the runner as the PM merged it (task loop 4c).

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && git fetch origin && git merge --no-edit origin/feat/workspace-21 && git merge-base --is-ancestor feat/workspace-21-runner HEAD; echo "runner merged: $?"; git ls-files workspace/src/runner.ts docker/workspace/Dockerfile | wc -l
```
→ `runner merged: 0`, then `2`. A `1` means the runner branch has commits the phase branch lacks: stop.

**3.** The two test files.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && node --test docker/grep-clean.test.mjs 2>&1 | grep -E "(tests|pass|fail) [0-9]+$"
```
→ `tests 13`, `pass 13`, `fail 0` (11 before the review round's two tests)
```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && node --test docker/workspace/init-firewall.test.mjs 2>&1 | grep -E "(tests|pass|fail) [0-9]+$"
```
→ `tests 21`, `pass 21`, `fail 0` (about 45 seconds; 18 before wave 2b's two tests, 20 before the
test the docker step's second run added on 2026-10-07)

**4.** The Dockerfile's and the service's literals.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && grep -c -E "CLAUDE_CODE_VERSION=latest|bb2dash-mcp:local" docker/workspace/Dockerfile; grep -c "^RUN chown -R root:root /usr/local/share/npm-global$" docker/workspace/Dockerfile; grep -c "^ *iproute2" docker/workspace/Dockerfile; grep -c 'DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER: "1"' compose.yaml
```
→ `0`, `1`, `0`, `1`

Ruling V2's literals: the one copy of the CA and its mode, the mode of the turns' folder, the
setting, the rag launcher's path, and no second CA under the rag server.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && grep -c "^COPY --from=harness-certs prod-ca.crt /app/certs/prod-ca.crt$" docker/workspace/Dockerfile; grep -c "^RUN chmod 0444 /app/certs/prod-ca.crt$" docker/workspace/Dockerfile; grep -c "^ && chmod 0555 /app/turn$" docker/workspace/Dockerfile; grep -c "^      WORKSPACE_DB_CA_FILE: /app/certs/prod-ca.crt$" compose.yaml; grep -c "^readonly CA_CERT=/app/certs/prod-ca.crt$" docker/workspace/mcp-rag.sh; cat docker/workspace/Dockerfile docker/workspace/mcp-rag.sh | grep -c "mcp-rag/certs"
```
→ `1`, `1`, `1`, `1`, `1`, `0`

**5.** The four secret files exist (sizes only; nobody prints a file).

```
for n in workspace_runner_db_url claude_oauth_token bb2dash_mcp_service_key harness_database_url; do printf '%s %s\n' "$n" "$(stat -c %s "/c/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets/$n")"; done
```
→ four lines, each a size above 0

**6.** What the desktop's sign-in task sees: only the two Windows user variables, no profile.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && ( unset HARNESS_DIR COMPOSE_PROFILES; SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets BB2DASH_DIR=C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash docker compose -f compose.yaml config --quiet ); echo "exit=$?"
```
→ `exit=0`
```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && ( unset HARNESS_DIR COMPOSE_PROFILES; SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets BB2DASH_DIR=C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash docker compose -f compose.yaml config --services )
```
→ `sync` and nothing else

**7.** The service as compose renders it for the test project.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace config --format json | node -e "let s='';process.stdin.on('data',d=>s+=d).on('end',()=>{const w=JSON.parse(s).services.workspace;console.log([w.ports===undefined,w.init,w.platform,Object.keys(w.networks).join(),w.profiles.join(),w.stop_grace_period].join(' '))})"
```
→ `true true linux/amd64 workspace-net workspace 30s`
```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace config --format json | node -e "let s='';process.stdin.on('data',d=>s+=d).on('end',()=>{const e=JSON.parse(s).services.workspace.environment;console.log(Object.keys(e).sort().map(k=>k+'='+e[k]).join(' '))})"
```
→ `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1 CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/home/node/.claude DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1 ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=false WORKSPACE_DB_CA_FILE=/app/certs/prod-ca.crt WORKSPACE_TURN_BUDGET_USD=1.00` and no other name

**8.** The `sync` service still renders the hash the live container was made with.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && ( unset HARNESS_DIR COMPOSE_PROFILES; SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets BB2DASH_DIR=C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash docker compose -f compose.yaml config --hash sync ); docker inspect -f '{{ index .Config.Labels "com.docker.compose.config-hash" }}' bb2dash-sync-1
```
→ `sync 448f155ac0209cc0a233a9d09653fd02ebb3eda51fc84ec02ff9a5341ac7e6e7`, then the same hash alone

**9.** The harness commit the image bakes (paste it into 102a), and nothing uncommitted beside it.

```
git -C C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness rev-parse HEAD; git -C C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness status --short -- mcp-server certs | wc -l
```
→ the commit (`e7997f3e3ddc402a3c8f535d3b926bbd61d6adbd` on 2026-10-06;
`57ee51fc18ee4f7f367b60b24bfe39968d58d86b` on 2026-10-07, after harness PR #40 moved it to
`fastembed` 2.1.1), then `0`

**10.** Build **(guard)**. It downloads the base image, three `npm ci` sets, the CLI (about 250 MB)
and the embedding model: run it in the background, it outlasts a short tool call.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace build workspace; echo "exit=$?"
```
→ `exit=0`

**11.** The image, and the one layer that holds the CLI.

```
docker images bb2dash-workspace:local --format '{{.ID}} {{.Size}}'; docker history --no-trunc bb2dash-workspace:local --format '{{.Size}} {{.CreatedBy}}' | grep "npm-global"
```
→ the image's id and size, then three lines: the `COPY /usr/local/share/npm-global …` layer with its
size, and two `ENV` lines of `0B`. Paste the COPY layer's size into 102a: about 250 MB when the copy
kept the package's link, about 500 MB when it did not (the image works either way). `--no-trunc`
(ruling U2): without it `docker history` cuts each line at 45 characters, and a grep can miss the
words it looks for.

**12.** Start **(guard)**.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace up -d --no-deps workspace; echo "exit=$?"
```
→ `exit=0`

**13.** What the start made.

```
docker network ls --filter name=bb2dash-wt21 --format '{{.Name}}'; docker volume ls --filter name=bb2dash-wt21 --format '{{.Name}}'
```
→ `bb2dash-wt21_workspace-net` and `bb2dash-wt21_workspace-claude-home`, and nothing else

**14.** The firewall's own log.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace logs --no-log-prefix workspace | grep -E "host of|Allowing DNS|Allowed |IPv6|Firewall"
```
→ in this order (the address counts may differ; the IPv6 line is this one or one of the two
`No IPv6 here …` lines, and which one goes into 102a):

```text
The host of workspace_runner_db_url ends .pooler.supabase.com
The host of harness_database_url ends .pooler.supabase.com
Allowing DNS to 127.0.0.11
Allowed api.anthropic.com on tcp/443 (1 address(es), pinned in /etc/hosts)
Allowed goultdzqcavefcgnifdy.supabase.co on tcp/443 (2 address(es), pinned in /etc/hosts)
Allowed <the pooler's host name> on tcp/5432 (1 address(es), pinned in /etc/hosts)
IPv6 closed (loopback only)
Firewall configuration complete
Firewall verification passed - unable to reach https://example.com as expected
Firewall verification passed - able to reach https://api.anthropic.com as expected
Firewall raised: 3 name(s) allowed
```

On 2026-10-07 the three counts read 1, 2 and 3. A count is of addresses, each once: this laptop's
resolver answers the pooler's name with each of its three A records twice, and since `defc566` the
script pins and counts the three (before it, the line read 6 and step 25 disagreed with step 24).

**15.** Health.

```
docker inspect -f '{{.State.Health.Status}}' "$(cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace ps -q workspace)"
```
→ `healthy` (read it again every 10 seconds while it says `starting`; `unhealthy` is the failing result)

**16.** The CLI is the pinned one, and its help still lists the six flags.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace claude --version
```
→ `2.1.289 (Claude Code)`
```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace sh -c "claude --help | grep -c -E -- '^  --(tools|permission-prompts|strict-mcp-config|setting-sources|system-prompt-snapshot|include-hook-events) '"
```
→ `6`

**17.** Every Node and `claude` process is `node`'s (Docker's own healthcheck apart).

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace sh -c "ps -o user=,args= -C node,claude | grep -v healthcheck.js | awk '{print \$1}' | sort -u"
```
→ `node`

**18.** The runner itself, not PID 1 (`docker-init`), holds no capability and can regain none.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace sh -c 'echo "pid 1: $(tr "\0" " " </proc/1/cmdline)"; p=$(pgrep -f "^node /app/workspace/dist/runner[.]js$"); echo "runner pid: $p"; grep -E "^(Uid|Cap(Inh|Prm|Eff|Bnd|Amb)):" /proc/$p/status'
```
→ `pid 1:` a command line that begins `/sbin/docker-init --` and ends with the runner's (`init: true`),
then `runner pid:` one number above 1, then `Uid:` with `1000` four times and five `Cap…:` lines, each
`0000000000000000`. The pattern is anchored at both ends, so it matches the runner's own command line
and neither `docker-init`'s, which holds the same words, nor this line's shell.

**19.** No API key and no `DATABASE_URL`; the five settings.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace printenv ANTHROPIC_API_KEY; echo "exit=$?"
```
→ `exit=1`
```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace printenv DATABASE_URL; echo "exit=$?"
```
→ `exit=1`
```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace printenv ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER WORKSPACE_DB_CA_FILE
```
→ five lines: `false`, `1`, `/home/node/.claude`, `1`, `/app/certs/prod-ca.crt`

**20.** The in-image layout: the frozen paths, with ruling V2's two changes (the one CA under
`/app/certs`, root's and read-only; `/app/turn` root's, 0555 and empty).

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace sh -c 'ls /app/workspace/dist/runner.js /app/workspace/dist/healthcheck.js /app/workspace/dist/hooks/tool-gate.js /app/workspace/claude/settings.json /app/workspace/prompts/system.md /app/workspace/package.json /app/mcp-materials/package.json /app/mcp-materials/dist/index.js /app/mcp-rag/package.json /app/mcp-rag/dist/index.js /app/certs/prod-ca.crt /app/mcp-rag/mcp-rag.sh | wc -l; ls -d /app/workspace/node_modules /app/mcp-materials/node_modules /app/mcp-rag/node_modules /opt/fastembed | wc -l; stat -c "%U:%G %a %n" /home/node/.claude /run/workspace /app/turn /app/certs /app/certs/prod-ca.crt; ls -A /app/turn | wc -l; ls -d /app/mcp-rag/certs 2>/dev/null | wc -l; test -r /app/certs/prod-ca.crt && echo "node reads the CA"'
```
→ `12`, then `4`, then five lines: `/home/node/.claude` and `/run/workspace` are `node:node`'s, the
second with mode `700`; then `root:root 555 /app/turn`, `root:root 755 /app/certs` and
`root:root 444 /app/certs/prod-ca.crt`. Then `0` (the turns' folder is empty), `0` (no second CA
under the rag server) and `node reads the CA`. If the last line is missing, `node` cannot reach the
file (read the modes of the folder and the file above it): the rag launcher then exits 78, and after
SR-1 the runner stops at its start, since a CA it cannot read is a configuration error (ruling V1),
so step 15 would not have read `healthy`.

**21.** The CLI's folder is root's, `node` cannot write it, and there is no `ip` program.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace sh -c 'stat -c "%U:%G %a" /usr/local/share/npm-global; find /usr/local/share/npm-global ! -user root | wc -l; for d in /usr/local/share/npm-global /usr/local/share/npm-global/bin /usr/local/share/npm-global/lib/node_modules/@anthropic-ai/claude-code; do test -w "$d" && echo "WRITABLE $d"; done; command -v ip || echo "no ip"'
```
→ `root:root 755`, then `0`, then `no ip` (no `WRITABLE` line)

**22.** `node` can write none of root's files.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace sh -c 'for f in /etc/hosts /app/docker/workspace/init-firewall.sh /app/docker/workspace/entrypoint.sh /app/workspace/dist/runner.js /app/workspace/claude/settings.json /app/mcp-rag/mcp-rag.sh /opt/fastembed /dev/shm/bb2dash-workspace-firewall.up /app/turn /app/certs /app/certs/prod-ca.crt; do test -w "$f" && echo "WRITABLE $f"; done; echo done'
```
→ `done` alone

**23.** Nothing can be planted where a turn loads project settings (ruling V2). As `node`, from the
turns' own folder: making `.claude`, making a file and loosening the folder's mode all fail.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node -w /app/turn workspace sh -c 'exec 2>&1; pwd; mkdir .claude; echo "mkdir exit=$?"; touch settings.json; echo "touch exit=$?"; chmod 0777 .; echo "chmod exit=$?"; ls -A | wc -l; stat -c "%U:%G %a" .'
```
→ nine lines:

```text
/app/turn
mkdir: cannot create directory '.claude': Permission denied
mkdir exit=1
touch: cannot touch 'settings.json': Permission denied
touch exit=1
chmod: changing permissions of '.': Operation not permitted
chmod exit=1
0
root:root 555
```

Any `exit=0` here is the failing result: the image is not the ruling's. Stop, and before anything
else take out what the line made, as root, so no later turn loads it:

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u root workspace sh -c 'rm -rf /app/turn/.claude /app/turn/settings.json; ls -A /app/turn | wc -l'
```
→ `0` (run only after a failing result; after a passing one there is nothing to remove)

**24.** The pins: one line per allowed name, with how many addresses it has.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace sh -c 'grep "pinned by init-firewall.sh" /etc/hosts | cut -d" " -f2 | sort | uniq -c'
```
→ three names (four if the two database secrets name different poolers), the counts those of step 14

**25.** The rules and the sets, read as root.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u root workspace sh -c 'iptables -S OUTPUT; ip6tables -S OUTPUT; for s in workspace-https workspace-postgres; do echo "$s $(ipset list "$s" | grep -c -E "^[0-9]")"; done'
```
→ `-P OUTPUT DROP`, then the OUTPUT rules in the dry run's order as iptables prints them (loopback;
udp and tcp 53 to `127.0.0.11`; the state rule; tcp 443 with `--match-set workspace-https dst`; tcp
5432 with `--match-set workspace-postgres dst`; the reject), then `-P OUTPUT DROP` and the one
loopback rule for IPv6, then one line per set, each the sum of step 24's counts for its kind:
`workspace-https 3` and `workspace-postgres 3` on 2026-10-07 (the pooler's count was written here as
1 before a real resolver had answered). A set smaller than its pins is the failing result

**26.** The tool gate is wired, not only written.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace node -e "const c=require('/app/workspace/claude/settings.json').hooks.PreToolUse[0].hooks[0].command;const r=require('child_process').spawnSync(c,{shell:true,input:JSON.stringify({hook_event_name:'PreToolUse',tool_name:'mcp__rag__search_context',tool_input:{query:'x',collection:'estac'}})});console.log(c,r.status)"
```
→ `node /app/workspace/dist/hooks/tool-gate.js 2`

**27.** Egress by name (check (e) as the brief writes it).

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace node -e "fetch('https://example.com',{signal:AbortSignal.timeout(5000)}).then(r=>console.log(r.status),()=>console.log('blocked'))"
```
→ `blocked`
```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace node -e "fetch('https://storage.googleapis.com',{signal:AbortSignal.timeout(5000)}).then(r=>console.log(r.status),()=>console.log('blocked'))"
```
→ `blocked`

Added on 2026-10-07: the host the embedding model is downloaded from since the harness moved to
`fastembed` 2.1.1 (step 9's commit). The line above is the brief's, for the host the older version
used; this one is for the host the image's own copy of the library names.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace node -e "fetch('https://huggingface.co',{signal:AbortSignal.timeout(5000)}).then(r=>console.log(r.status),()=>console.log('blocked'))"
```

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace node -e "fetch('http://host.docker.internal:6080',{signal:AbortSignal.timeout(5000)}).then(r=>console.log(r.status),()=>console.log('blocked'))"
```
→ `blocked` (run while `bb2dash-sync-1` is up)

The same port by literal address (ruling U2), so the answer does not rest on whether
`host.docker.internal` can be looked up from behind the firewall: Docker Desktop's address for the
host (`192.168.65.254`), this container's own gateway (read from `/proc/net/route`), and whatever
`host.docker.internal` resolves to, if it resolves at all.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace node -e "const net=require('net'),fs=require('fs'),dns=require('dns').promises;const once=(a,p)=>new Promise(r=>{const s=net.connect({host:a,port:p,timeout:5000});s.on('connect',()=>{s.destroy();r('open')});s.on('timeout',()=>{s.destroy();r('blocked')});s.on('error',()=>r('blocked'))});(async()=>{const gw=fs.readFileSync('/proc/net/route','utf8').split('\n').map(l=>l.split('\t')).filter(f=>f[1]==='00000000').map(f=>f[2].match(/../g).reverse().map(h=>parseInt(h,16)).join('.'));const named=await dns.lookup('host.docker.internal').then(r=>[r.address],()=>[]);for(const a of [...new Set(['192.168.65.254',...gw,...named])])console.log(a+':6080',await once(a,6080))})()"
```
→ `192.168.65.254:6080 blocked`, then `<the gateway>:6080 blocked` (a third line only if
`host.docker.internal` resolved to another address): every line `blocked`. That the port is
published while this runs is read, not dialled (nothing connects to the sync container):

```
docker inspect -f '{{json .NetworkSettings.Ports}} {{.State.Status}}' bb2dash-sync-1
```
→ `{"6080/tcp":[{"HostIp":"127.0.0.1","HostPort":"6080"}]} running`
```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace node -e "fetch('https://api.anthropic.com',{signal:AbortSignal.timeout(5000)}).then(r=>console.log(r.status),()=>console.log('blocked'))"
```
→ a number (any HTTP status)
```
docker inspect -f '{{range $k, $v := .NetworkSettings.Networks}}{{$k}} {{end}}' "$(cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace ps -q workspace)"
```
→ `bb2dash-wt21_workspace-net` and nothing else

**28.** The token smoke (the PM's; one Haiku turn on Stack's plan; R19's line with this list's
prefix, `-T`, and stdin closed so the CLI does not wait on it), run from `/app/turn` (ruling V2: the
smoke still passes from the folder every turn runs in, now root's and 0555). It is the one turn the
list always had, moved to that folder with `-w /app/turn`: no second turn is spent.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node -w /app/turn workspace sh -c 'CLAUDE_CODE_OAUTH_TOKEN="$(cat /run/secrets/claude_oauth_token)" claude -p --model haiku --tools "" --max-budget-usd 0.05 -- "Reply with the one word ok"' </dev/null; echo "exit=$?"
```
→ `ok` (`^ok\.?$`, case ignored), then `exit=0`. If it fails on the network, the missing host goes
into `HTTPS_HOSTS` in `docker/workspace/init-firewall.sh`, into 102a and into a DECISIONS row. If it
fails because the CLI cannot write under `/usr/local/share/npm-global`, say so in 102a and the one
COPY line gets `--chown=node:node` (ruling T1's exception). If it fails because the CLI cannot write
in its working directory, say so in 102a and stop: the folder's mode is the ruling's, and loosening
it is the PM's call, not a fix to make at this step.

The turn left nothing in its working directory, and the folder is as the image made it:

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace sh -c 'ls -A /app/turn | wc -l; stat -c "%U:%G %a" /app/turn'
```
→ `0`, then `root:root 555`

**29.** Egress by literal address (ruling T1): these prove the address and port rule, not a failed
lookup. First, on the host and not in the container, that the four targets answer from this laptop.
The fourth is the pooler on 6543 (ruling U2: the claim is probed, not only stated); the program reads
the pooler's host from the secret file and prints neither it nor anything else of the file:

```
node -e "const net=require('net'),fs=require('fs');const once=(h,p)=>new Promise(r=>{const s=net.connect({host:h,port:p,timeout:6000});s.on('connect',()=>{s.destroy();r('open')});s.on('timeout',()=>{s.destroy();r('no answer')});s.on('error',()=>r('no answer'))});(async()=>{for(const [h,p] of [['1.1.1.1',443],['api.anthropic.com',80],['goultdzqcavefcgnifdy.supabase.co',80]])console.log(h+':'+p,await once(h,p));let v='not read';try{v=await once(new URL(fs.readFileSync('C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets/workspace_runner_db_url','utf8').trim()).hostname,6543)}catch{}console.log('the pooler:6543',v)})()"
```
→ four lines ending `open` (the first three as read on 2026-10-06), the last `the pooler:6543 open`

One public address that is not allowed, on 443:

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace node -e "const s=require('net').connect({host:'1.1.1.1',port:443,timeout:5000});s.on('connect',()=>{console.log('1.1.1.1:443 open');s.destroy()});s.on('timeout',()=>{console.log('1.1.1.1:443 blocked');s.destroy()});s.on('error',()=>console.log('1.1.1.1:443 blocked'))"
```
→ `1.1.1.1:443 blocked`

Every allowed address, read from the container's own pins and dialled as an address, on its own port
and on three that are not allowed:

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace node -e "const net=require('net'),fs=require('fs');const once=(a,p)=>new Promise(r=>{const s=net.connect({host:a,port:p,timeout:5000});s.on('connect',()=>{s.destroy();r('open')});s.on('timeout',()=>{s.destroy();r('blocked')});s.on('error',()=>r('blocked'))});(async()=>{for(const l of fs.readFileSync('/etc/hosts','utf8').split('\n').filter(l=>l.endsWith('# pinned by init-firewall.sh'))){const [a,n]=l.split(' ');for(const p of [443,80,5432,6543])console.log(n,a+':'+p,await once(a,p))}})()"
```
→ four lines per pin, `<name> <address>:<port> open|blocked`. `open` on exactly these: each
`api.anthropic.com` and `goultdzqcavefcgnifdy.supabase.co` address on `:443`, each pooler address on
`:5432`. Every other line `blocked`: one `open` and three `blocked` per pin, so with 2026-10-07's
counts (six pins) 6 `open` and 18 `blocked`. (Port 80 on
the two HTTPS names and 6543 on the pooler answer from the host, as the host line above shows on the
day, so those `blocked` lines are the port rule at work.) The lines hold allowed addresses: in 102a
each is written as `<address>`, never as the number.

**30.** A second run of the firewall, as root, is refused, and changes nothing.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u root workspace sh -c '/app/docker/workspace/init-firewall.sh; echo $?'
```
→ one `ERROR: the firewall was already raised in this container …` line, then `75`. Then run step
27's `example.com` and `api.anthropic.com` lines and step 29's `1.1.1.1` line again: still
`blocked`, a number, and `1.1.1.1:443 blocked`.

**31.** Ten TCP connects to each database secret's host on port 5432. It reads the host from each
secret file inside the container and prints one count per secret, never the URL.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace node -e "const net=require('net'),fs=require('fs');const once=h=>new Promise(r=>{const s=net.connect({host:h,port:5432,timeout:5000});s.on('connect',()=>{s.destroy();r(1)});s.on('timeout',()=>{s.destroy();r(0)});s.on('error',()=>r(0))});(async()=>{for(const n of ['workspace_runner_db_url','harness_database_url']){let ok=0;try{const h=new URL(fs.readFileSync('/run/secrets/'+n,'utf8').trim()).hostname;for(let i=0;i<10;i++)ok+=await once(h)}catch{ok=0}console.log(ok+'/10')}})()"
```
→ `10/10` twice (`0/10` for a file it cannot parse, and nothing else)

**32.** The runner's database connection is verified against the pinned CA (ruling V2, for SR-1).
Inside the container, as `node`: a connect that trusts only `/app/certs/prod-ca.crt` succeeds, and
the same connect trusting only a different CA fails. Three lines. First the different CA: a
throwaway self-signed certificate made in the container's temp folder (its key goes to `/dev/null`;
nothing trusts it and nothing else reads it).

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace sh -c 'rm -rf /tmp/w65-ca; mkdir -m 700 /tmp/w65-ca && openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:2048 -nodes -days 1 -subj "/CN=w65 throwaway CA" -keyout /dev/null -out /tmp/w65-ca/other-ca.crt 2>/dev/null; echo "openssl exit=$?"; grep -c "BEGIN CERTIFICATE" /tmp/w65-ca/other-ca.crt'
```
→ `openssl exit=0`, then `1`. (`openssl exit=127` means the image has no `openssl` program: say so
in 102a and stop at this step. It is expected to be there: Debian's `ca-certificates`, which the
image installs, depends on it.)

Then the two connects. The program reads the DSN from the secret file and builds the client from
its parsed parts (host, port, user, password, database), never from the string, with
`ssl: { ca, rejectUnauthorized: true, servername: <host> }`: the settings ruling V1 gives the
runner. It uses the runner's own `pg` module. It prints, per CA file, `connected as <the role>` or
`refused: <the error's code>`, and nothing of the secret (a secret that does not parse prints
`the secret did not parse`).

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace node -e "const fs=require('fs'),{Client}=require('/app/workspace/node_modules/pg');let u;try{u=new URL(fs.readFileSync('/run/secrets/workspace_runner_db_url','utf8').trim())}catch{console.log('the secret did not parse');process.exit(1)}const once=async f=>{let c;try{c=new Client({host:u.hostname,port:Number(u.port||5432),user:decodeURIComponent(u.username),password:decodeURIComponent(u.password),database:decodeURIComponent(u.pathname.slice(1)),ssl:{ca:fs.readFileSync(f,'utf8'),rejectUnauthorized:true,servername:u.hostname},connectionTimeoutMillis:10000});c.on('error',()=>{});await c.connect();const r=await c.query('select current_user as u');return 'connected as '+r.rows[0].u}catch(e){return 'refused: '+(e.code||'no code')}finally{if(c)c.end().catch(()=>{})}};(async()=>{for(const f of ['/app/certs/prod-ca.crt','/tmp/w65-ca/other-ca.crt'])console.log(f,await once(f));process.exit(0)})()"
```
→ two lines:

```text
/app/certs/prod-ca.crt connected as workspace_runner
/tmp/w65-ca/other-ca.crt refused: SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN
```

The first line must read exactly so. The second must be `refused:` with a certificate code:
`SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN` is what the PM read on the host on 2026-10-06 against the system store,
and what this program printed against a stand-in whose chain ends in its own root (below, "Review
round"). `connected` on the second line is the failing result: the pooler's certificate is then not
being checked. A second line of `refused: ECONNREFUSED`, `ETIMEDOUT`, `ENOENT` or `no code` proves
nothing either way (the connect never reached the certificate, or the throwaway file is missing):
read step 31 and the first line of this step again.

Last, the throwaway goes:

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace sh -c 'rm -rf /tmp/w65-ca; ls -d /tmp/w65-ca 2>/dev/null | wc -l'
```
→ `0`

What this step shows: from inside the container, behind the firewall, the pooler's certificate
verifies against the CA the image holds and against no other, with the ruling's settings. What it
does not show is the runner's own code: that `workspace/src/db.ts` builds its client this way
whatever the DSN says is W-64's (its tests, with a CA made for the test). The two meet at step 15:
after SR-1 a runner that reads `healthy` has reached the database through a connection checked
against the file `WORKSPACE_DB_CA_FILE` names (step 19), and a missing or empty file stops it.

**33.** One `search_context` call over stdio to the rag launcher, collection `bb2dash`. It prints one
word: `ok` (a result that is not an error), `error`, `server exited` or `timeout`.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace node -e "const cp=require('child_process');const p=cp.spawn('bash',['/app/mcp-rag/mcp-rag.sh'],{stdio:['pipe','pipe','ignore']});let buf='';const send=m=>p.stdin.write(JSON.stringify(m)+'\n');const done=v=>{console.log(v);p.kill();process.exit(v==='ok'?0:1)};setTimeout(()=>done('timeout'),90000);p.on('exit',()=>done('server exited'));p.stdout.on('data',d=>{buf+=d;let i;while((i=buf.indexOf('\n'))>=0){const line=buf.slice(0,i);buf=buf.slice(i+1);let m;try{m=JSON.parse(line)}catch{continue}if(m.id===1){send({jsonrpc:'2.0',method:'notifications/initialized'});send({jsonrpc:'2.0',id:2,method:'tools/call',params:{name:'search_context',arguments:{query:'Workspace',collection:'bb2dash'}}})}if(m.id===2)done(m.result&&(m.result.isError||false)===false?'ok':'error')}});send({jsonrpc:'2.0',id:1,method:'initialize',params:{protocolVersion:'2024-11-05',capabilities:{},clientInfo:{name:'w65-check',version:'0'}}})"
```
→ `ok` (the search embedded its query with the model in `/opt/fastembed`: step 27 shows the model's
host is blocked; and the launcher found the CA at `/app/certs/prod-ca.crt`, or it would have exited
78 and the word would be `server exited`)

**34.** Before the restart: when the firewall's marker was made, how many pins there are, and the
container's id and start time.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace sh -c 'stat -c "marker made at %Y" /dev/shm/bb2dash-workspace-firewall.up; grep -c "pinned by init-firewall.sh" /etc/hosts'
```
→ `marker made at <seconds>`, then the pin count (the sum of step 24's counts: 6 on 2026-10-07)
```
docker inspect -f '{{.Id}} {{.State.StartedAt}}' "$(cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace ps -q workspace)"
```
→ the Workspace container's id and start time

**35.** Restart **(guard)** (ruling T1: a restart must re-raise the firewall).

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace restart workspace; echo "exit=$?"
```
→ `exit=0`. Then step 15's line → `healthy` again (re-read while `starting`).

**36.** After the restart: the marker went with it and was made anew, and the pins were rewritten.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace exec -T -u node workspace sh -c 'stat -c "marker made at %Y" /dev/shm/bb2dash-workspace-firewall.up; grep -c "pinned by init-firewall.sh" /etc/hosts'
```
→ a later `marker made at` than step 34's, and the same pin count as step 34 (not twice it). Had
`/dev/shm` kept the marker, the second start would have been refused with 75 and the container would
not be healthy.
```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace logs --no-log-prefix workspace | awk '/Firewall raised: /{raised++} /a second run is refused/{refused++} END{print raised+0, refused+0}'
```
→ `2 0` (one `Firewall raised` line per start, and no refusal in the container's own log)
```
docker inspect -f '{{.Id}} {{.State.StartedAt}}' "$(cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace ps -q workspace)"
```
→ the same id as step 34 (a restart, not a new container) and a later start time. Then step 27's
`example.com` and `api.anthropic.com` lines and step 29's `1.1.1.1` line once more: `blocked`, a
number, `1.1.1.1:443 blocked`.

**37.** Task 13: the image's filesystem into a scratch volume **(guard before)**. `w65-scan` is
created and never started, and is removed in the line that exports it. It carries the compose
labels of the image it is made from (compose stamps `com.docker.compose.project` and
`com.docker.compose.service` on an image it builds, and a container inherits its image's labels),
so for the seconds it exists a label filter on project `bb2dash-wt21` can list it; it has none of
the labels compose gives a container it starts itself (no number, no config hash), and no compose
command is run while it exists (ruling U2).

```
docker volume create w65-scan-fs && docker create --name w65-scan bb2dash-workspace:local
```
→ `w65-scan-fs`, then a container id
```
docker export w65-scan | MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker run --rm -i -v w65-scan-fs:/fs alpine:3.20 tar -x -C /fs; echo "exit=$?"; docker rm w65-scan
```
→ `exit=0`, then `w65-scan`

**38.** Task 13: no secret in the image's files. The scan reads the whole image and can take minutes:
run it in the background. `--redact` keeps a finding's value out of the output.

```
MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker run --rm -v w65-scan-fs:/fs:ro -v "C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container/docker/gitleaks-images.toml:/work/docker/gitleaks-images.toml:ro" -w /work ghcr.io/gitleaks/gitleaks:v8.30.1 dir /fs --config docker/gitleaks-images.toml --redact; echo $?
```
→ `0`

**39.** Task 13: no secret in the image's history.

```
docker history --no-trunc bb2dash-workspace:local | MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker run --rm -i -v "C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container/docker/gitleaks-images.toml:/work/docker/gitleaks-images.toml:ro" -w /work ghcr.io/gitleaks/gitleaks:v8.30.1 stdin --config docker/gitleaks-images.toml --redact; echo $?
```
→ `0`
```
docker history --no-trunc bb2dash-workspace:local | grep -c -E "sk-ant-|sb_secret_|eyJhbGciOi|postgres(ql)?://[^ ]*:[^ @]*@"
```
→ `0`

**40.** Task 13: the scratch volume goes **(guard after)**.

```
docker volume rm w65-scan-fs
```
→ `w65-scan-fs`

A hit under the new vendor trees (`/fs/usr/local/share/npm-global/`, the three `node_modules` under
`/fs/app/`, `/fs/opt/fastembed/`) is triaged by hand in 102a with `--verbose` added. None of them is
under the allowlist's three paths (`/fs/usr/(include|lib|share)/`, `/fs/usr/local/include/`,
`/fs/ms-playwright/`), so a hit there shows. Widening the allowlist is a DECISIONS call, not this
stream's.

**41.** When this tree is done with the test container (only one tree at a time runs it) **(guard)**.

```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace stop workspace
```
```
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace rm -sf workspace
```
→ the container stopped, then removed. The network and the volume stay until the PM removes them
after acceptance step 15 (`docker network rm bb2dash-wt21_workspace-net`,
`docker volume rm bb2dash-wt21_workspace-claude-home`).

## Wave 2 — the lines' quoting, checked without docker

Run on 2026-10-06 over the 50 docker lines of the list above, read back out of this file from a shell
with `SECRETS_DIR`, `HARNESS_DIR`, `COMPOSE_PROFILES` and `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV` unset, with `docker`
standing for a native program that starts nothing and records its arguments, its folder and those
variables:

```text
calls: 61 (compose 41, of them exec 25; other docker 20); sh -c strings parsed: 12; node -e programs compiled: 9
lines with a docker call: 50 of 50
problems: 0
```

For every compose call of the test project it checked: `SECRETS_DIR` and `HARNESS_DIR` hold the two
folders and were set by the line itself; `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`; `-p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace`;
the service is named after `build`, `up`, `exec`, `logs`, `ps`, `restart`, `stop` and `rm`; `up` has
`-d --no-deps`; every `exec` has `-T`; the call ran from the worktree. For every call: no argument
shows Git Bash's path conversion (a bare `/run/secrets/x` otherwise arrives as
`C:/Program Files/Git/run/secrets/x`, read on this laptop). Every `sh -c` string parses (`bash -n`),
every `node -e` program compiles (`node --check`) and holds no `!`, which an interactive bash expands
inside double quotes. The two lines that render the file as the desktop's sign-in task does were
checked the other way round: `HARNESS_DIR` and `COMPOSE_PROFILES` unset, `SECRETS_DIR` set.

The check can fail: three deliberately wrong lines (no prefix and a bare container path; a `!` in a
program; an `up` without the service) gave 8 problems. The two piped lines of step 7 printed their
expected text from a stand-in render. What this shows is that each line arrives as written. It does
not show what a line prints from a real container: that is the next step.

The lines of the list that do not call docker were run as they stand, from another folder, and gave
what the list says: the two test runs (11 of 11, 18 of 18), step 4's four counts (`0`, `1`, `0`,
`1`), step 5's four sizes (each above 0), step 9's commit and `0`, and step 28's host probe (three
`open`). Step 2's line was not run whole: its fetch and merge were run on their own, and its
ancestor check read `1` for the reason given above.

## Wave 2 — for the `/security-review` request (ruling T1's last bullet)

Facts from this stream the PM's request can quote:

* **The allowlist is by address, and both kinds of host serve other tenants.** The bb2dash project's
  name resolves to a CDN's edge addresses and the pooler is shared by many projects; `api.anthropic.com`
  is one address for every customer. After wave 2 an allowed address can be reached on one TCP port
  only (443 or 5432), which narrows what can be asked of it, not who answers. TLS names the peer on
  443; the rag server checks the pooler's certificate against the pinned CA; the runner's own
  connection follows its DSN's `sslmode`.
* **Docker's healthcheck runs `node /app/workspace/dist/healthcheck.js` as root every 30 s.** The
  service sets no `user:` (the entrypoint must start as root for the firewall), so a healthcheck
  process is root's, with the container's added capabilities. It reads one file's age
  (`/run/workspace/alive`, in a folder `node` owns) and runs code from a root-owned folder. The
  entrypoint's drop does not cover it.
* **Two write-capable credentials are mounted** (`bb2dash_mcp_service_key`, `harness_database_url`),
  each read by one MCP server process; and `workspace_runner_db_url` and `claude_oauth_token` by the
  runner. `node` can read all four files: the fence is the tool gate and the read-only tools, not
  file permissions.
* **Two clauses no container check exercises**, both held by the dry-run test only: IPv6 when
  `ip6tables` cannot set its rules (the test "IPv6 (T1 d)" and the long-list test), and a DSN host
  that does not end `.pooler.supabase.com` (the test "a database secret that is not a pooler URL").
* **DNS after the firewall is up.** Rules allow DNS only to the resolvers in `/etc/resolv.conf`
  (Docker's `127.0.0.11`). A name that is not pinned cannot be resolved from inside the container if
  Docker forwards the query from the container's own network namespace, which is what the by-name
  probes of step 26 would then show as `blocked`; the literal probes of step 28 do not depend on it.
* The pg_net reach is W-63's and the PM's to word; nothing in this stream touches it.

## Wave 2 — questions for the PM

1. **A new file beyond the Files table: `docker/workspace/init-firewall.test.mjs`.** The ruling asks
   for the dry-run harness to be extended and its run quoted, and the wave's rule asks for a test
   committed failing before the fix; a scratch script cannot be committed failing. It sits in W-65's
   folder, the image does not copy it, and `grep-clean` does not scan it. The Files table wants one
   row for it, or it goes back to scratch.
2. **The CLI is installed in a stage of its own and copied** (above, "The image"). The recipe and the
   ruling's `chown -R root:root /usr/local/share/npm-global` are both in the Dockerfile to the
   letter; the stage is the one thing not asked for. It keeps a 246 MB binary from being stored a
   second time by the chown. Step 11 records the layer's size. If the PM wants the plain form (the
   chown as one more `RUN` of the runtime stage), it is a six-line change and an image about that
   much larger.
3. **A DSN on a port other than 5432 is not refused at the start** (choice 3 above). The ruling
   names the ports, not a check of the DSN's own. One word and `dsn_host` refuses it with a fixed
   sentence.
4. **bb2dash-stack still says "this repo's secrets/ folder" in three places the ruling did not
   name**, so they were left: `.env.example` (its header line "Secrets are files in secrets/" and the
   comment and placeholder over `SECRETS_DIR=/path/to/bb2dash-stack/secrets`), the doctor's message
   for an unset `SECRETS_DIR` (`doctor/lib/checks-host.mjs`, `secretsDirOf`: "set it in .env to this
   repo's secrets/ folder, absolute"; that file is W-65's for one comment only), and the justfile's
   fallback to `justfile_directory() / "secrets"` with its comment. The README now says the fallback
   exists and is not for real secrets.
5. **The `secrets` row still wants `workspace_runner_db_url` when the profile is off** (all 12, as
   the brief's check (a) reads and as it does for the dev container's tokens). Only the Workspace row
   follows the profile, which is what the ruling says. With the profile off and that file missing,
   `just doctor` shows one problem row, `secrets`.
6. **With the profile off the Workspace row asks Docker nothing**, so a container left running after
   the line is taken out of `.env` still reads `off`. The README tells Stack to stop it
   (`docker compose stop workspace`) when he takes the line out.
7. **`grep-clean` stays at 11 tests.** Wave 2's three rules are assertions inside the existing
   Dockerfile test, so the count the ruling names did not move.

(Answered by rulings U2 on 2026-10-06: 1 and 2 accepted, 3 a refusal at the start, 4 corrected where
it is a comment or a message, 5 and 6 accepted for v1. See "Wave 2b".)

## Wave 2b (2026-10-06) — ruling U2, then the docker step (ruling U4)

First step of the wave: `git fetch origin`, `git merge --no-edit origin/feat/workspace-21` into
`feat/workspace-21-container` (no conflict; the phase branch was at `37f46cf`), pushed as `c7832ec`.
bb2dash-stack needed no merge.

### A. Ruling U2 (files only)

| U2 item | what changed | where | red → green |
|---|---|---|---|
| a DSN whose port is not 5432 is refused at the start | `dsn_host` refuses it with the fixed sentence `its port is not 5432`; nothing of the value is printed | `docker/workspace/init-firewall.sh` | `af314fe`, `757b649` → `4dd15e3` |
| the header says exactly what the script prints | a "What it prints" paragraph, held by a test that also reads a start's log | `docker/workspace/init-firewall.sh` | the same three commits |
| bb2dash-stack wording, `secrets/` → `SECRETS_DIR` | comments and one message; no behaviour | bb2dash-stack `compose.yaml`, `.env.example`, `doctor/lib/checks-host.mjs` | `f858c0e` → `80f6796` |
| the paste-ready list, four corrections | below | this file | `b4c33a2` (docs) |

**The port check.** RED, the tests before the code (`af314fe`):

```text
node --test docker/workspace/init-firewall.test.mjs
✖ a database secret on a port other than 5432 stops the start at deny-all, and nothing of it is printed (U2)
    AssertionError: The host of workspace_runner_db_url ends .pooler.supabase.com … Firewall raised …
    actual: 0,   expected: 1
✖ the header says what a start prints, and a start prints no more: names and the resolver, never an address of an allowed host (U2)
    AssertionError: the header has its "What it prints" paragraph
✖ dsn_host: a pooler URL gives its host, anything else is refused with a fixed sentence
    AssertionError: <the test's fake pooler URL, on port 6543>
    actual: '0',   expected: '1'
ℹ tests 20
ℹ pass 17
ℹ fail 3
```

The first failure is the wave 2a script doing what choice 3 said: a secret on 6543 started, and the
firewall was raised. One more test commit (`757b649`, still red) changed one expected sentence of the
header test before any code: the first wording said the script never prints "any part" of a
connection string, and a pooler's host name is a part of one.

GREEN (`4dd15e3`):

```text
node --test docker/workspace/init-firewall.test.mjs
ℹ tests 20
ℹ pass 20
ℹ fail 0
node --test docker/grep-clean.test.mjs
ℹ tests 11
ℹ pass 11
ℹ fail 0
```

What the rule is, in words:

* A URL that names a port other than 5432 stops the start, before any rule is touched, at deny-all,
  with `<secret name>: its port is not 5432`. The text after the first colon of the host part is
  compared as text, so `6543`, `54329`, `05432`, a colon with nothing after it and `5432:6543` are
  all refused. The test reads that neither the port nor the host of a refused secret is printed.
* **A URL that names no port is accepted**: it means 5432, Postgres's default, which both clients
  use and which is the one port the pooler's addresses are allowed on. Wave 2a's test already held
  three such URLs as allowed, and the runner's own config (`workspace/src/config.ts`) accepts them
  too. If the PM wants an explicit `:5432` required, it is one condition in `dsn_host`.
* **The header's paragraph is what the script prints, which is one thing more than the ruling's
  short form** ("the fixed host names and each validated pooler host name, never a user, password,
  URL or address"): the line `Allowing DNS to <resolver>` prints the address of each resolver in
  `/etc/resolv.conf` (Docker's own, `127.0.0.11`), and the end check prints its two fixed URLs
  (`https://example.com`, `https://api.anthropic.com`). The header says so, and says what never
  shows: a user, a password, a database name, a query string, a whole connection string, anything of
  a refused secret but its name, and the address of an allowed host. The test holds it: in a
  working start's log the only IPv4 address is the resolver's. The script's output was not changed.

**bb2dash-stack.** RED (`f858c0e`):

```text
node --test doctor/workspace.test.mjs doctor/doctor.test.mjs
✖ compose.yaml, .env.example and the doctor say the secrets live in the folder SECRETS_DIR names, outside every repo (bb2dash rulings U2)
    AssertionError: compose.yaml, the header
ℹ tests 52
ℹ pass 51
ℹ fail 1
```

GREEN (`80f6796`): `tests 52`, `pass 52`, `fail 0`; the three other test files that read
`compose.yaml`, `.env.example` or the README: 32 of 32.

* `compose.yaml`: the header (where `just` gets `SECRETS_DIR`, where the secrets live, what the
  `./secrets` fallback is for), the `secrets` line of the header's list, one comment over the
  secrets block, and the dev container's comment ("Any secrets/ folder in it"). No line of YAML
  changed: the twelve `file: ${SECRETS_DIR:-./secrets}/<name>` lines are as they were, and the test
  reads one of them.
* `.env.example`: the header line and the comment over `SECRETS_DIR`; the placeholder is
  `/path/to/a-folder-outside-every-repo` (it was `/path/to/bb2dash-stack/secrets`). It is still an
  absolute placeholder, which `doctor.test.mjs` asserts.
* `doctor/lib/checks-host.mjs`: the message for an unset `SECRETS_DIR` reads `SECRETS_DIR is not
  set: set it in .env to the folder that holds the secret files, outside every repo, absolute`
  (its first words are unchanged: `doctor.test.mjs` reads them), and the function's comment.
* The `justfile` is untouched. Its comment already says the secrets live outside every repo
  (DECISIONS 2026-10-03) and that the repo folder is what an unset `SECRETS_DIR` falls back to.

**The list's four corrections** (`b4c33a2`): step 11 reads `docker history --no-trunc`; step 35's
note says the scan container carries the image's compose labels and is never started; step 26 gains
a literal-address probe of port 6080 (Docker Desktop's host address, the container's own gateway,
and whatever `host.docker.internal` resolves to) and a read, not a dial, of the sync container's
published port; step 28's host line probes the pooler on 6543 (it reads the host from the secret
file and prints nothing of it). Step 3's expected count is 20. The two new programs compile
(`node --check`) and hold no `!`, `$`, backtick or double quote.

### B. The docker step (tasks 12 and 13): stopped at step 10, the build

**The image did not build, so no container was started and no check of task 12 or 13 that needs
the image was run.** Steps 1 to 9 of the list passed. Step 10 failed in the `rag` stage: the
embedding model's download address answers 403 to an anonymous caller (read from this laptop on
2026-10-06, outside docker too), so the bake the Contract describes cannot work today. It is not the
firewall, not Docker, not memory, and not this branch's code. Nothing was retried, no other way round was
tried in docker, and the choice is the PM's ("Questions for the PM, wave 2b", below).

**The guard**, `docker inspect -f '{{.Id}} {{.State.StartedAt}}' bb2dash-sync-1`:

| when (2026-10-06, UTC) | output |
|---|---|
| 20:18:54, before anything of the wave touched docker | `bd4d4ae8bb716c53141fcae699d3872dd72c44622674209ed496d04d28305f02 2026-10-05T22:06:22.891074981Z` |
| 20:24:29, step 1, before the first docker step | the same |
| 20:27:07, after step 10 (the failed build) | the same |
| 20:29:39, after reading what the failed build left | the same |
| 20:40:49, the last read of the wave | the same |

At that last read `docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace ps --all workspace` printed its
header and no row, and `docker ps -a` listed the same five containers as before the build.

No refusal: the session ran every docker line it was given.

**Before the build** (read-only): `docker ps -a` listed five containers, none of project
`bb2dash-wt21` (`bb2dash-sync-1` up 22 hours and healthy, `bb2dash-harness-jobs-1`,
`harness-postgres` and two `bb2dash-mcp:local` containers with Docker's own names). The daemon has
12.5 GB; the laptop had 7.8 GB of 31.9 GB free. Docker 29.8.1, Compose v5.5.1.

**Steps 1 to 9, as run** (each line is the list's, unchanged):

| step | what | output | |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | the guard | above | pass |
| 2 | fetch, merge, the runner is in the tree | `Already up to date.` · `runner merged: 0` · `2` (also `0` against `origin/feat/workspace-21-runner`, `95b04b6`; HEAD `b4c33a2`) | pass |
| 3 | `grep-clean` | `tests 11` · `pass 11` · `fail 0` | pass |
| 3 | the firewall's dry run | `tests 20` · `pass 20` · `fail 0` | pass |
| 4 | the Dockerfile's and the service's literals | `0` · `1` · `0` · `1` | pass |
| 5 | the four secret files, sizes only | `169` · `108` · `41` · `109` bytes, each above 0 | pass |
| 6 | compose with only the Windows user variables | `exit=0`; services: `sync` and nothing else | pass |
| 7 | the service as rendered for the test project | `true true linux/amd64 workspace-net workspace 30s` | pass |
| 7 | its environment | `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1 CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/home/node/.claude DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1 ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=false WORKSPACE_TURN_BUDGET_USD=1.00` | pass |
| 8 | the `sync` service's hash, rendered and on the live container | `sync 448f155ac0209cc0a233a9d09653fd02ebb3eda51fc84ec02ff9a5341ac7e6e7` · the same hash | pass |
| 9 | the harness commit, and nothing uncommitted under `mcp-server` or `certs` | `e7997f3e3ddc402a3c8f535d3b926bbd61d6adbd` (branch `main`) · `0` | pass |

Task 12's compose config check (its check (d), the part that needs no container) is steps 6 to 8:
pass.

**Step 10, the build** (one build, in the background, 20:26:01 to 20:26:38 UTC):

```text
cd /c/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash-wt-21-container && SECRETS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets HARNESS_DIR=C:/Users/stack/agentic-harness MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1 docker compose -p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace build workspace; echo "exit=$?"
exit=1
```

What finished before it stopped (BuildKit's own step numbers and times):

```text
#20 [runner 4/7] RUN npm ci --no-audit --no-fund                                       DONE 5.7s

#13 [stage-4 2/21] RUN apt-get update && apt-get install …                             CANCELED
```

So the runner, the materials server and the pinned CLI build as written, from W-64's package as
merged. The step that failed:

```text
#32 [rag 7/7] RUN npm run build && FASTEMBED_CACHE_DIR=/opt/fastembed node scripts/verify-embedder.mjs && npm prune … && chmod -R u=rwX,go=rX /opt/fastembed

```

The harness's `tsc` passed; the model step failed 0.14 s after it began, which is not a download of
130 MB.

**The cause, read outside docker** (20:27 to 20:40 UTC; reads only, and one scratch install):

* The harness rag server is on `fastembed` 2.1.0 (its `package-lock.json`; `npm ci` installs exactly
  that). 2.1.0 fetches a dense model from one fixed address and does not look at the answer's
  status (`node_modules/fastembed/lib/cjs/fastembed.js`, `downloadFileFromGCS`: the body is piped
  into the `.tar.gz` file whatever it is, then unpacked):
  `https://storage.googleapis.com/qdrant-fastembed/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5.tar.gz`.
* That address answers 403 from this laptop, with no docker in the way:

  ```text
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}\n" https://storage.googleapis.com/qdrant-fastembed/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5.tar.gz
  403
  <Error><Code>AccessDenied</Code><Message>Access denied.</Message><Details>Anonymous caller does not have
  storage.objects.get access to the Google Cloud Storage object. … (or it may not exist).</Details></Error>
  ```

  The same with a browser's user agent, with and without a range; the bucket's own listing is 403
  too. The 399-byte XML is what was written to `fast-bge-small-en-v1.5.tar.gz`: hence
  `TAR_BAD_ARCHIVE`.
* The library's author moved the download: `fastembed` 2.1.1 (published 2026-09-30; 3.0.0 on
  2026-09-24) fetches dense models from Hugging Face, this one from `Qdrant/bge-small-en-v1.5-onnx-Q`
  (read in the two packages' `lib/cjs/fastembed.js`, unpacked in scratch; neither holds the
  `storage.googleapis.com` address any more).
* Stack's host still answers searches because it has the model on disk already
  (`agentic-harness/mcp-server/.fastembed-cache/fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/`, 2026-09-28), and the live
  `harness-jobs` container has a `fastembed-cache` volume (not read here). **Any first download with the harness
  as it is fails the same way**: a new machine, the dev container's `npm run verify:embedder`, or
  `harness-jobs` if its volume is ever lost. That is the harness's, not this phase's, and it is in
  the report for Stack.

**What a fix would bake, measured in scratch** (no docker, no file of either repo changed; the
harness checkout's `git status` read the same two untracked files before and after):

| | the file | bytes | sha256 |
|---|---|---|---|
| what the host's rag server reads today (2.1.0, from the closed address) | `fast-bge-small-en-v1.5/model_optimized.onnx` | 132,883,455 | `20e3bd67…6b2e` |
| what 2.1.1 downloads from Hugging Face | `Qdrant_bge-small-en-v1.5-onnx-Q/model_optimized.onnx` | 66,465,124 | `51f1bd0a…2431` (the scratch download, and Hugging Face's own `X-Linked-ETag`) |

They are two different files. The second is, byte for byte, the file in the harness's Python
ingestion cache (`~/.cache/fastembed/models--qdrant--bge-small-en-v1.5-onnx-q/…/model_optimized.onnx`:
the same sha256), and the harness's own docs record the two routes as measured equal on 2026-09-09
(`CONTEXT.md`, `docs/embeddings.md`: cosine 0.99999975 to 0.99999985). Measured again here: the five
build inputs the Dockerfile's `rag` stage copies (`package.json`, `package-lock.json`,
`tsconfig.json`, `src/`, `scripts/`) were copied to scratch, `npm ci`, then
`npm install fastembed@2.1.1`, `npm run build`, and the stage's own bake line:

```text
FASTEMBED_CACHE_DIR=<scratch>/cache node scripts/verify-embedder.mjs
model:      BAAI/bge-small-en-v1.5
expected:   384 dimensions
"What did we decide about the ledger cash invariant?"   dims 384   L2 1.000000
"pgvector HNSW index configuration"                      dims 384   L2 1.000000
OK — embedder matches the ingestion contract.
exit 0
```

and three sentences embedded twice, once by the harness's installed 2.1.0 reading its own cache,
once by 2.1.1 reading the Hugging Face files:

```text
sentence 1 cosine 0.99999977 maxAbsDiff 1.83e-4
sentence 2 cosine 0.99999964 maxAbsDiff 3.55e-4
sentence 3 cosine 0.99999981 maxAbsDiff 1.74e-4
```

So with 2.1.1 the harness's source builds unchanged, its embedder check passes, and its vectors
agree with today's to six decimal places. 2.1.1 keeps its files under
`<cache>/Qdrant_bge-small-en-v1.5-onnx-Q/` and skips a file that is already there
(`retrieveModel`: "Files already present are skipped"), so a baked model should need no network at
run time; step 31 of the list is what proves that behind the firewall. No file of the Workspace
names the model's folder (`docker/workspace/mcp-rag.sh` and the Dockerfile name `/opt/fastembed`
only), so **after such a bump in the harness this branch needs no change**: the same step 10 line
would bake the Hugging Face model. This is evidence for a ruling, not a change: W-65 edits nothing
in the harness.

**What the failed build left** (read at 20:29 UTC):

```text
docker images | grep workspace                                                   → nothing: no bb2dash-workspace:local
docker ps -a --filter label=com.docker.compose.project=bb2dash-wt21              → nothing
docker network ls --filter name=bb2dash-wt21 · docker volume ls --filter name=bb2dash-wt21   → nothing, nothing
```

Build cache only (the finished stages; a second build reuses them). No container, network or volume
of the test project exists, no scan container or scan volume was made, and nothing was pruned.

**Steps 11 to 39: not run.** Each needs the image.

| task 12 check | list steps | result |

**The firewall has still not met a kernel.** Everything this file says about it rests on the dry
run against fake tools (20 of 20).

### Questions for the PM, wave 2b

1. **The image cannot be built until the model has a source that answers.** Three ways, the first
   recommended:
   * **(a) The harness moves to `fastembed` 2.1.1** (one dependency, its lock file; a harness PR,
     not W-65's). Evidence above: it builds unchanged, its embedder check passes, the vectors agree
     with today's to six decimal places, and the file is the one Python ingestion already uses. This
     branch then needs no change; the build bakes whatever the harness checkout holds, and the new
     harness commit goes into 102a at build time. It also repairs every first download of the
     harness itself. The Contract's sentence stays true as written (the model is baked by loading
     the built server's embedder once).
   * **(b) Bake the host's copy**: a third named build context on
     `${HARNESS_DIR}/mcp-server/.fastembed-cache` and one `COPY`. It is byte for byte what the host
     reads today, and it needs no harness change, but the Contract says the stage never copies the
     host's `.fastembed-cache`, the image then builds only on a machine that already has the model,
     and `compose.yaml`, the Dockerfile and `grep-clean` all change.
   * **(c) Wait** for the address to come back. Nothing suggests it will: the library's author
     moved off it a week ago.
2. **A URL with no port is accepted by the new port check** (it means 5432). One condition makes an
   explicit `:5432` required, if the PM reads "refused" that way.
3. **The header's paragraph lists one address and two URLs** the ruling's short form leaves out: the
   resolver's own address (`Allowing DNS to 127.0.0.11`) and the end check's two fixed URLs. The
   script's output was not changed to fit the sentence; the sentence was written to fit the output.
   If the resolver's address should not be printed, it is one `echo`.
4. **`.env.example`'s placeholder changed** (`/path/to/a-folder-outside-every-repo`): a value in an
   example file, not a comment. It is the line a new machine copies, and it pointed inside the repo.
5. **When the build passes, the list runs from step 10 as written.** The finished stages are in
   Docker's build cache, so the second build is short. Nothing in steps 11 to 39 was changed by what
   was found here.

## Review round (2026-10-06) — ruling V2, files only

First step of the round: `git fetch origin`, `git merge origin/feat/workspace-21` into
`feat/workspace-21-container` (a fast-forward to `e9f0852`, the phase branch with the two reviews
and rulings V1 to V5; no conflict), pushed. bb2dash-stack needed no merge and has no change in this
round: nothing in it names the CA's path, `/app/turn` or the new setting (`git grep` there finds
only the host's own `scripts/mcp-rag.sh`, which reads the harness checkout's file, not the image's).

**No docker command that changes state was run**: no build, no container, no `exec`. What was run
against docker is `docker inspect` (the guard and one label) and `docker compose … config`. So
nothing below shows what the image is like once built: every such check is a step of the list,
still owed from step 10 on, and the build still waits for the embedding model's source (wave 2b).

| V2 item | what changed | where | red → green |
|---|---|---|---|
| the image copies the CA to `/app/certs/prod-ca.crt`, root's and readable | one `COPY` from the `harness-certs` context and one `RUN chmod 0444`; the copy under `/app/mcp-rag/certs/` is gone | `docker/workspace/Dockerfile` | `1f9698d`, `f2dd191` → `6e9e4e6` |
| the service sets `WORKSPACE_DB_CA_FILE=/app/certs/prod-ca.crt` | one line under `environment:`, and the comment over `secrets:` says what the one `*_FILE` variable names | `compose.yaml` | the same three |
| the rag launcher may read the same file | `CA_CERT=/app/certs/prod-ca.crt`; its `[ -r "$CA_CERT" ] \|\| fail` check and the hand-over as `DATABASE_CA_CERT` are as they were | `docker/workspace/mcp-rag.sh` | the same three |
| `/app/turn` is root's and 0555 | `chown root:root /app/turn` and `chmod 0555 /app/turn`; only `/home/node/.claude` is still handed to `node` | `docker/workspace/Dockerfile` | the same three |
| `docker/grep-clean.test.mjs` and its literal checks follow | two tests (13 in all), each with planted wrong forms it must catch | `docker/grep-clean.test.mjs` | the two test commits |
| the list gains the three checks and is renumbered | below | this file | `6032669` (docs) |

One more commit, `6490367`, is a comment in the Dockerfile (who cannot write `/app/turn`).

### RED, the tests before the files (`1f9698d`)

One more test commit before any code was committed (`f2dd191`, still red): the first form of the CA
test expected `COPY --chmod=0444`. With that flag the mode of the folder `COPY` makes for the file
(`/app/certs`) is the builder's to choose, and no build can be run in this round to read it: a
folder without its search bit would leave the CA unreadable to `node`. The test now expects a plain
`COPY` (the folder and the file are then root's, as every other `COPY` of this image is) and one
`RUN chmod 0444` after it, the only command that may name the CA or its folder. Its run, in a
scratch copy of that commit (`git archive f2dd191 …`, outside every repo, since the working tree
already held the first form of the fix):

### GREEN (`6e9e4e6`)

```text
node --test docker/grep-clean.test.mjs
✔ ruling V2: one pinned CA at /app/certs/prod-ca.crt, root's and read-only, named by the service and read by the rag launcher
✔ ruling V2: /app/turn is root's and 0555, so the runtime user can plant nothing where a turn loads project settings

```

The four changed files hold no carriage return (counted as bytes; `git ls-files --eol` reads
`i/lf w/lf` for each).

What the two tests hold, in words. Both read the Dockerfile's last stage only (the image), with
line continuations joined, and each runs its check over planted wrong forms as well, so a check
that matches nothing cannot pass:

* **The CA.** The stage holds exactly `COPY --from=harness-certs prod-ca.crt /app/certs/prod-ca.crt`
  and no other `COPY` of the file (a `--chown`, a `--chmod` or a second destination is another
  line, and fails); exactly one shell command names the CA or its folder, `chmod 0444
  /app/certs/prod-ca.crt`, and it comes after the copy; the `workspace` service holds
  `WORKSPACE_DB_CA_FILE: /app/certs/prod-ca.crt` as a setting, not as a comment; the launcher holds
  `readonly CA_CERT=/app/certs/prod-ca.crt`, its `[ -r "$CA_CERT" ] || fail` check and
  `DATABASE_CA_CERT="$CA_CERT"`, and names no CA of its own. Planted: the image as it was before the
  ruling (six problems), a copy that is `node`'s, a `chmod 0666` afterwards, a `chown -R node:node
  /app/certs`, a mode set before the copy, and a setting that is only a comment.
* **`/app/turn`.** The stage makes the folder, hands it to `root:root` and to nobody else, gives it
  `0555` and no other mode, names it in no other command, and no `COPY`, `ADD`, `VOLUME` or
  `WORKDIR` fills, mounts or remakes it; `compose.yaml` does not name it for the service (a mount
  would hide the image's folder and its mode). Planted: the folder as it was before the ruling
  (`chown node:node`, no mode), a later `chmod -R 0777`, a `COPY` into it, a compose volume on it,
  and the same lines in a stage that is not the last.

### What was chosen where the ruling leaves room

1. **One CA file in the image, not two.** The ruling says the rag launcher may read the same file,
   and it now does: `/app/mcp-rag/certs/` is no longer made. Both database connections are checked
   against one root-owned file, and there is no second copy to forget. The brief still names the
   old path in four places and the old owner of `/app/turn` in two; they are the PM's to change
   (question 1).
2. **A plain `COPY` and one `RUN chmod 0444`, not `COPY --chmod`** (above). The file is 0444
   whatever mode the build host gave it (a Windows checkout hands Docker 0755). The cost is one
   more layer that holds the 1,367-byte file again.
3. **`chown root:root /app/turn` is written out**, though a folder made by `RUN` in a stage with no
   `USER` line is root's already: the test then reads a literal and not the absence of one.
4. **Mode 0555 is against `node`, not against root.** Root keeps every capability Docker gives a
   container, so Docker's own healthcheck (`node …/healthcheck.js` as root, every 30 s: wave 2's
   note for the security review) could still write there. It reads one file and writes none.
5. **The compose comment over `secrets:`** said no `*_FILE` variable is set for this service. It now
   says no variable names a secret's file, and that the one `*_FILE` variable names the public CA.
   The brief's own sentence ("the service sets no `*_FILE` variable for them", the runner's two
   secrets) is still true as written.

What the image copies is public: `certs/prod-ca.crt` in the harness checkout (`e7997f3`, tracked,
unchanged) is one certificate, `CN=Supabase Root 2021 CA`, self-signed, a CA, valid to 2031-04-26,
1,367 bytes, with no private key in the file (read with Node's `X509Certificate`).

Wave 2's note for the security review said "the runner's own connection follows its DSN's
`sslmode`". After SR-1 (ruling V1, W-64's) that sentence no longer holds: the runner checks the
certificate against the file this stream bakes, whatever the DSN says.

### Checks run in the review round (read-only docker only)

**The guard**, `docker inspect -f '{{.Id}} {{.State.StartedAt}}' bb2dash-sync-1`:

| when (2026-10-06, UTC) | output |
|---|---|
| 21:41:35, before the first compose read | `bd4d4ae8bb716c53141fcae699d3872dd72c44622674209ed496d04d28305f02 2026-10-05T22:06:22.891074981Z` |
| 21:42:20, after the config reads | the same |
| after the list's lines were run against the stand-in docker | the same |
| 21:52:14, after steps 1 to 9 and the last commit of code | the same |

**The `sync` service is unchanged, and the two trees render it alike.** With only the Windows user
variables (`SECRETS_DIR`, `BB2DASH_DIR`; `HARNESS_DIR` and `COMPOSE_PROFILES` unset):

| where | `docker compose -f compose.yaml config --hash sync` |
|---|---|
| `C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash` (`main`, `e89aff5`) | `sync 448f155ac0209cc0a233a9d09653fd02ebb3eda51fc84ec02ff9a5341ac7e6e7` |
| `bb2dash-wt-21-container` after the edit (`6e9e4e6`) | the same |
| the live container's label `com.docker.compose.config-hash` | `448f155ac0209cc0a233a9d09653fd02ebb3eda51fc84ec02ff9a5341ac7e6e7` |

The hash leaves the build section out, so the whole rendered service was compared as well
(`config --format json` in each tree, `services.sync`): the same nineteen keys, and every one equal
but `build`, where the one difference is `context`, each tree's own folder. Both trees render one
service (`sync`), the network `default`, the volumes `bb-profile` and `course-files` and `sync`'s
four secrets. An `up` from the merged file does not recreate the live container.

**The compose file resolves with only the user variables set** (the same shell):

```text
docker compose -f compose.yaml config --quiet; echo "exit=$?"                 → exit=0
docker compose -f compose.yaml config --services                             → sync
docker compose -f compose.yaml --profile workspace config --services         → workspace, sync
```

**The `workspace` service as rendered for the test project** (`-p bb2dash-wt21 --profile workspace`,
step 7's two lines and one more read):

```text
true true linux/amd64 workspace-net workspace 30s
CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1 CLAUDE_CONFIG_DIR=/home/node/.claude DISABLE_AUTOUPDATER=1 ENABLE_TOOL_SEARCH=false WORKSPACE_DB_CA_FILE=/app/certs/prod-ca.crt WORKSPACE_TURN_BUDGET_USD=1.00
volumes: ["/home/node/.claude"]   tmpfs: none   user: unset   additional_contexts: harness-certs, harness-mcp
```

One new name in the environment, and it is a literal: nothing new is interpolated. No mount lands
on `/app/turn` or `/app/certs`, so the image's own folders and modes are what a container sees.

**Steps 1 to 9 of the list, run as they stand** (read back out of this file, from a shell with
`SECRETS_DIR`, `HARNESS_DIR`, `COMPOSE_PROFILES` and `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV` unset; none changes docker
state):

| step | what | output | |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | the guard | above | pass |
| 2 | fetch, merge, the runner is in the tree | `Already up to date.` · `runner merged: 1` · `2` | **stop, as the step says** (below) |
| 3 | `grep-clean` | `tests 13` · `pass 13` · `fail 0` | pass |
| 3 | the firewall's dry run | `tests 20` · `pass 20` · `fail 0` | pass |
| 4 | the Dockerfile's and the service's literals | `0` · `1` · `0` · `1` | pass |
| 4 | ruling V2's literals | `1` · `1` · `1` · `1` · `1` · `0` | pass |
| 5 | the four secret files, sizes only | `169` · `108` · `41` · `109` bytes | pass |
| 6 | compose with only the Windows user variables | `exit=0`; services: `sync` and nothing else | pass |
| 7 | the service as rendered, and its environment | the two lines above | pass |
| 8 | the `sync` service's hash, rendered and on the live container | the hash above, twice | pass |
| 9 | the harness commit; nothing uncommitted under `mcp-server` or `certs` | `e7997f3e3ddc402a3c8f535d3b926bbd61d6adbd` · `0` | pass |

Step 2 read `1` at 21:51 UTC because the review round is still open: `feat/workspace-21-runner`
then held five commits of W-64's (CR-1, CR-2, CR-3, CR-5, CR-6) that the phase branch does not have
yet. That is the step doing its work: the image must not be built from a tree without the runner's
round. It reads `0` once the PM has merged the round into `feat/workspace-21` and this tree has
merged that.

### The list: three new checks, renumbered 1 to 41

The list under "Wave 2 — the lines for tasks 12 and 13" was changed in place (`6032669`). It still
runs top to bottom: steps 1 to 9 need no image, step 10 is the build, and everything after it needs
the image.

| the ruling's check | list step | what the step reads |
|---|---|---|
| as `node`, creating `/app/turn/.claude` fails | 23 (new) | from `/app/turn` itself: `mkdir .claude`, `touch settings.json` and `chmod 0777 .` each exit 1; the folder is empty and `root:root 555` |
| the token smoke still passes from that folder | 28 (was 27) | R19's line with `-w /app/turn`; then the folder is read again: empty, `root:root 555` |
| the runner's connection is verified | 32 (new) | a throwaway self-signed CA made in `/tmp/w65-ca`; a connect trusting only `/app/certs/prod-ca.crt` reads `connected as workspace_runner`, the same connect trusting only the throwaway reads `refused: SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN`; the throwaway is removed |

Steps that read the new literals: 3 (13 tests), 4 (a second line of six counts), 7 and 19 (the
setting), 20 (the CA's path, owner and mode; `/app/turn`'s owner, mode and emptiness; no
`/app/mcp-rag/certs`; `node` reads the CA), 22 (`node` can write neither folder nor the file), 33
(the rag search fails with `server exited` if the launcher cannot read the CA).

Old and new numbers (sections of this file written before the review round keep the old ones):

| before | 1 to 22 | none | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | none | 31 | 32 | 33 | 34 | 35 | 36 | 37 | 38 | 39 |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| now | 1 to 22 | 23 | 24 | 25 | 26 | 27 | 28 | 29 | 30 | 31 | 32 | 33 | 34 | 35 | 36 | 37 | 38 | 39 | 40 | 41 |

While renumbering, two sentences that said "step 26's first and fourth lines" were reworded to name
the lines (`example.com`, `api.anthropic.com`): wave 2b had added lines to that step, and "fourth"
no longer pointed at the line meant.

**The token smoke is one turn, not two.** The ruling asks that the smoke still pass from
`/app/turn`. The list's one smoke was moved there rather than doubled: ruling U4 allows one small
Haiku turn on Stack's plan, and a smoke from `/app/turn` shows everything the smoke from `/app`
showed (the token, the firewall's one host, a CLI whose install folder is root's). If the PM wants
both, it is the same line without `-w /app/turn` (question 2).

**What step 32 shows and what it does not.** It shows, from inside the container and behind the
firewall, that the pooler's certificate verifies against the CA the image holds and against no
other, with the settings ruling V1 gives the runner (the client built from the DSN's parsed parts,
`ssl: { ca, rejectUnauthorized: true, servername: <host> }`), through the runner's own `pg` module.
It does not run the runner's code: W-64's module is being changed in this same round, and a pasted
line cannot rest on its exports. That the runner itself connects this way is W-64's to prove (its
tests); the two meet at step 15, where a runner that reads `healthy` after SR-1 has reached the
database through a connection checked against the file step 19 shows it was given. The program
logs in as `workspace_runner` once (the second connect ends at the certificate, before any login)
and runs `select current_user`; it calls none of the five functions and touches no row.

**Step 32's program, run without docker and without the database** (scratch only). A stand-in for
the pooler was written for this: it answers the SSL request, serves TLS with a leaf for `localhost`
signed by a root made for the run (the chain sent with its root, as the pooler sends its own), and
answers a query with one row. The program was taken as the list holds it, with its four in-container
paths replaced by scratch paths and a made-up DSN of the stored one's shape; the throwaway CA was
made by the list's own `openssl` arguments (OpenSSL 3.5.8 here; the key to a file, since a Windows
`openssl` has no `/dev/null`); `pg` is 8.23.0, the runner's pin:

```text
openssl exit=0
1
program: 889 chars; forbidden characters: 0
--- the list's program:
<the CA the stand-in's certificate is signed by> connected as workspace_runner
<the throwaway CA> refused: SELF_SIGNED_CERT_IN_CHAIN
exit=0
--- control, verification off:
<the CA the stand-in's certificate is signed by> connected as workspace_runner
<the throwaway CA> connected as workspace_runner
exit=0
--- control, a secret that does not parse:
the secret did not parse
exit=1
--- the stand-in is down:
<the CA the stand-in's certificate is signed by> refused: ECONNREFUSED
<the throwaway CA> refused: ECONNREFUSED
exit=0
```

("Verification off" is the same program with `rejectUnauthorized:false`; the forbidden characters
are `!`, `$`, a backtick and a double quote; the two scratch paths are printed here by what they
are.) So the `refused` line is the certificate check and not the stand-in: with the check off, the
throwaway connects. A secret that does not parse prints one fixed line. A connect that never
reaches the certificate prints a code the step tells the reader not to count. This says nothing
about the real pooler's chain: that is step 32 itself, in the container.

**The lines' quoting, checked again without docker.** The same check as wave 2's ("the lines'
quoting", above), over the list as it now stands, with `docker` standing for a native program that
starts nothing and records what it was handed:

```text
calls: 69 (compose 48, of them exec 32; other docker 21); sh -c strings parsed: 17; node -e programs compiled: 11
lines with a docker call: 58 of 58
problems: 0
```

It read 50 lines in wave 2a; wave 2b added two and this round six (two of step 23, one of step 28,
three of step 32). For the new lines it was also read that `-w /app/turn` arrives as `/app/turn`,
that the `openssl` line's `-subj "/CN=w65 throwaway CA"` and `/dev/null` arrive unconverted, and
that step 32's program arrives as the 889 characters run against the stand-in pooler; step 7's two
piped lines printed their expected text from a stand-in render. The check can fail: five
deliberately wrong lines gave 11 problems, among them a `-w /app/turn` without
`MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`, which arrives as `C:/Program Files/Git/app/turn`.

### What this round does not show

No image exists, so each of these is a claim until its step is run:

* that the two changed instructions build (a plain `COPY` from a named context, two `RUN`s of
  `chown` and `chmod`; nothing new to Docker, and not run);
* the owners and modes in a real image (step 20), and that `node` can make nothing in `/app/turn`
  (step 23);
* **that the CLI runs from a working directory it cannot write** (step 28, and every turn after
  it). The earlier smoke's folder, `/app`, was root's too, and that smoke has never run either. If
  the CLI needs to write there, step 28 says to stop and report, not to loosen the mode;
* that `openssl` is in the image (step 32's first line; expected, since `ca-certificates` depends
  on it in Debian), and what the real pooler answers to the throwaway CA (step 32's second line);
* that the rag server still connects with the CA at its new path (step 33).

### Questions for the PM, review round

1. **The brief names the old literals in six places**, and this stream does not edit the brief:
   `/app/mcp-rag/certs/prod-ca.crt` in the layout sentence (lines 279 to 280), in the rag entry's
   `DATABASE_CA_CERT=` (line 615) and twice in the Seams table's row "W-64 and W-65" (line 834);
   "`/app/turn` owned by `node`" in line 293 and in the same row of line 834. Neither literal is
   one W-64's files name (`workspace/` holds no CA path of the rag server, and `/app/turn` is still
   the turns' folder), so the seam's two sides still agree. If the PM would
   rather keep a second copy of the CA under `/app/mcp-rag/certs/` so the first four stay true, it
   is one `COPY` line, one constant in the launcher and one expected line in the test.
2. **One smoke or two** (above): the list spends one Haiku turn, from `/app/turn`.
3. **Step 2 reads `runner merged: 1` until the review round is integrated.** Nothing to rule, only
   to expect: the build line is not to be pasted before it reads `0`.
4. **Nothing in the image reads `WORKSPACE_DB_CA_FILE` until W-64's SR-1 change is merged.** In this
   tree the runner's `config.ts` does not name the variable yet; the service sets it and the file is
   there. No test here ties the two together across the seam: after the merge, step 19 (the
   setting), step 15 (healthy) and step 32 are what show it end to end.

## Docker step, second run (2026-10-07) — tasks 12 and 13

**The image builds, the container is up and healthy, and every step from 1 to 40 passed on the image
that is now running.** One step failed on the way: step 25, on the first image, where the firewall
had pinned six lines for the pooler's three addresses. That was this stream's script. It was fixed
test-first (one round of the two allowed), the image was rebuilt, and the list was run again from
step 10. Step 41 (stop and remove the test container) was not run, on purpose: the PM walks the
preview against this container next. One Haiku turn was spent (step 28), and no second one.

First step of the run: `git fetch origin`, `git merge --no-edit origin/feat/workspace-21` (a
fast-forward, `45712fc..9df56e9`, the runner's review round with SR-1), pushed. Nothing was merged
to `main`, nothing was applied to the database, no file of the harness was edited, and no command
was refused.

### The guard

`docker inspect -f '{{.Id}} {{.State.StartedAt}}' bb2dash-sync-1`, every reading the same line:
`bd4d4ae8bb716c53141fcae699d3872dd72c44622674209ed496d04d28305f02 2026-10-05T22:06:22.891074981Z`.

| when (2026-10-07, UTC) | read |
|---|---|
| 05:16:44, step 1, before the first docker step | the line above |
| 05:18:33, right before the first build | the same |
| 05:24:55, after the first build | the same |
| 05:25:12, after the container started (first image) | the same |
| 05:31:19, before the second build (the fix round) | the same |
| 05:31:27, after the second build | the same |
| 05:31:49, after the container was made again on the second image | the same |
| 05:35:08, before the restart of step 35 | the same |
| 05:35:19, after the restart | the same |
| 05:36:02, before task 13's scan container | the same |
| 05:38:27, after the scan volume was removed | the same |
| 05:40:17, after the last check | the same |

Before the first docker step `docker ps -a` listed the same five containers as on 2026-10-06
(`bb2dash-sync-1` up 31 hours and healthy, `bb2dash-harness-jobs-1`, `harness-postgres`, and the two
`bb2dash-mcp:local` containers with Docker's own names), no image named `bb2dash-workspace`, and no
network or volume of project `bb2dash-wt21`. The laptop had 5.3 GB of 31.2 GB free; the daemon has
12.5 GB. One build ran at a time, each waited for.

### What ran, in order

1. Steps 1 to 9 (no image needed): all pass.
2. Step 10, the first build, 05:18:39 to 05:24:46 UTC: `exit=0`.
3. Steps 11 to 26 on the first image. Step 25 failed its count: the set held 3 pooler addresses and
   step 24 had read 6 pins. Step 26 had been sent in the same paste as 24 and 25 and passed; nothing
   after it was run on the first image.
4. The fix round: a failing test (`f5ab661`), then the fix (`defc566`), both pushed.
5. Step 10 again, the second build, 05:31:21 to 05:31:26 UTC (38 steps from the cache; only the copy
   of the two scripts and the `sed`/`chmod` after it ran): `exit=0`.
6. Steps 11 to 40 on the second image: all pass. Step 28, the token smoke, ran once, here.

### The image and what it bakes

| | |
|---|---|
| the image now running | `sha256:5790950804c5813992d495efb945efb9a9832b45d0d0e57f9be78911e07577ae`, `1.66GB` (1,657,569,563 bytes), `amd64`, made 2026-10-07T05:31:25Z |
| the first image (before the fix) | `sha256:de4a7a0edac5086283fbe8bf55a340bb092674bc105eb2d29f5101354c32257c`, `1.66GB`. Docker dropped it when its container was made again; nothing was removed by hand |
| the harness commit baked | `57ee51fc18ee4f7f367b60b24bfe39968d58d86b` (branch `main`, "Merge pull request #40 … fastembed-2.1.1"), nothing uncommitted under `mcp-server` or `certs`; read before each build |
| the CLI's layer | `492MB COPY /usr/local/share/npm-global /usr/local/share/npm-global # buildkit`: the copy did not keep the package's link, so the binary is stored twice. The image works either way (step 11's note) |
| the embedding model | `fastembed` 2.1.1 in `/app/mcp-rag/node_modules`; `/opt/fastembed` holds `Qdrant_bge-small-en-v1.5-onnx-Q`, 65M, 5 files, all root's |

The step that failed on 2026-10-06 now passes, with no change on this branch (as wave 2b said it
would after the harness's bump):

```text
#43 [rag 7/7] RUN npm run build  && FASTEMBED_CACHE_DIR=/opt/fastembed node scripts/verify-embedder.mjs  && npm prune … && chmod -R u=rwX,go=rX /opt/fastembed

#43 110.3 OK — embedder matches the ingestion contract.

```

The long parts of the first build: the runtime stage's `apt-get` 133.7 s, the rag server's `npm ci`
218.0 s, the bake above 111.3 s, the export 28.9 s. The two instructions the review round added (a
plain `COPY` of the CA from the named context, then `RUN chmod 0444`) and the `/app/turn` line built
as written.

### The firewall, the first time it met a real kernel

The first start's log, whole, as the container printed it (05:25:12 UTC, the first image):

```text
The host of workspace_runner_db_url ends .pooler.supabase.com
The host of harness_database_url ends .pooler.supabase.com
Restoring Docker DNS rules...

Allowed aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com on tcp/5432 (6 address(es), pinned in /etc/hosts)
IPv6 closed (loopback only)

2026-10-07T05:25:12.791Z workspace: runner started as workspace@469c97cc522a
2026-10-07T05:25:13.255Z workspace: db: connected as workspace_runner
```

What that shows, read against the dry run:

* **It raised at the first try, in under a second, and its own end check passed**: `example.com`
  refused, `api.anthropic.com` answered. The lines and their order are the dry run's.
* **The IPv6 line is `IPv6 closed (loopback only)`**: `ip6tables` works in Docker Desktop's kernel
  on this laptop, so neither of the two `No IPv6 here …` branches was taken.
* **Docker's own DNS rules were found and put back** (`Restoring Docker DNS rules...`), and the one
  resolver is `127.0.0.11`.
* **Both database secrets name the same pooler** (one lookup, one `Allowed` line for it).
* **The set type and the port rule work as written**: `hash:net` sets, and `iptables -S OUTPUT`
  prints the six rules in the dry run's order (step 25, below).
* **One thing disagreed with the dry run: the pooler's count.** The line says 6 addresses. There are
  3. That is the next section.

After the fix **every probe agreed with the dry run**: the rules in its order, the sets the size of
the pins, by name and by literal address `open` on exactly the allowed address and port pairs and
`blocked` everywhere else (steps 25, 27, 29), a second run refused with 75 (step 30), and a restart
raised it again with the pins rewritten, not doubled (steps 34 to 36).

### Step 25 on the first image, and the fix round

What step 24 and step 25 read on the first image:

```text
      1 api.anthropic.com
      6 aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com
      2 goultdzqcavefcgnifdy.supabase.co
…
workspace-https 3
workspace-postgres 3
```

The rules were right and so was the set. The pins were not: six lines for the pooler against three
addresses in its set. Diagnosed with reads only, inside the container (no address printed):

```text
pin lines per name (all / distinct addresses):
api.anthropic.com 1 1
goultdzqcavefcgnifdy.supabase.co 2 2
aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com 6 3
every pinned address is in its set:
      1 api.anthropic.com in workspace-https
      6 aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com in workspace-postgres
      2 goultdzqcavefcgnifdy.supabase.co in workspace-https
```

and the resolver's own answer, the same on three lookups (`dig` as the script calls it, addresses
written by number of first appearance):

```text
aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com. IN CNAME pool-tcp-us-east-1-e9f793b-79951640844772aa.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com.
pool-tcp-us-east-1-e9f793b-79951640844772aa.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. IN A <address 1>
pool-tcp-us-east-1-e9f793b-79951640844772aa.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. IN A <address 2>
pool-tcp-us-east-1-e9f793b-79951640844772aa.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. IN A <address 3>
pool-tcp-us-east-1-e9f793b-79951640844772aa.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. IN A <address 1>
pool-tcp-us-east-1-e9f793b-79951640844772aa.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. IN A <address 2>
pool-tcp-us-east-1-e9f793b-79951640844772aa.elb.us-east-1.amazonaws.com. IN A <address 3>
```

**The cause:** Docker Desktop's resolver answers the pooler's name, a CNAME to a load balancer, with
each of its three A records twice. The script took an answer's lines for its addresses: it pinned
each line in `/etc/hosts` and counted each. `ipset add -exist` took the repeats without complaint,
which is why the set was right. **Nothing was open that should not have been**: every pinned
address was in the set, and the set held nothing unpinned. What was wrong was the count the log
prints ("how many addresses it has", in the header's words) and three redundant lines in
`/etc/hosts`. The two HTTPS names answer without repeats. The dry run could not have shown this:
its fake `dig` only ever answered each address once.

**RED** (`f5ab661`, the test before the code): the fake `dig` gives the pooler three addresses,
each twice, and the test expects three pins, three `ipset add` calls, `3 address(es)` in the log,
and still one lookup a name.

```text
node --test docker/workspace/init-firewall.test.mjs
✖ an answer that repeats an address: each address is allowed, pinned and counted once
  AssertionError [ERR_ASSERTION]: Expected values to be strictly deep-equal:
    [
      '<POOLER_ADDRESS> aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com # pinned by init-firewall.sh',
      '198.51.100.7 aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com # pinned by init-firewall.sh',
      '203.0.113.21 aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com # pinned by init-firewall.sh',
  +   '<POOLER_ADDRESS> aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com # pinned by init-firewall.sh',
  +   '198.51.100.7 aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com # pinned by init-firewall.sh',
  +   '203.0.113.21 aws-0-us-east-1.pooler.supabase.com # pinned by init-firewall.sh'
    ]
ℹ tests 21
ℹ pass 20
ℹ fail 1
```

(The three addresses are the test's own, and none was read from the container: the constant the
file has used for its pooler since wave 1, written here by its name, and two from the ranges kept
for documentation. The output is otherwise as printed.)

**GREEN** (`defc566`): one condition in `resolve_once`. It keeps the first line for an address and
drops a repeat, in the answer's order: `awk '$4 == "A" && !seen[$5]++ {print $5}'`.

```text
bash -n docker/workspace/init-firewall.sh                 → ok
node --test docker/workspace/init-firewall.test.mjs       → tests 21, pass 21, fail 0
node --test docker/grep-clean.test.mjs                    → tests 13, pass 13, fail 0
```

It is inside the Contract ("adds every A record of that one answer to the set and pins each"): every
address of the answer is still allowed and pinned, once. The fix changes no rule, no set and no
host. On the second image steps 14, 24 and 25 read `3 address(es)`, `3` pins and
`workspace-postgres 3`. This small change went through its test and the list; it was not put through
`/code-review` or `/security-review` by this stream (the review round's reviews were of the tree
before it).

### Steps 1 to 41

Each line is the list's, as it stands. Where a step ran on both images and the two outputs differ,
both are given; "both images" means the outputs were the same. An output is quoted as printed;
` · ` separates its lines.

Three notes on how lines were run:

* **Step 29's last line** was run as the list holds it with one thing appended on the host side, a
  pipe into `awk` that writes each address as `<address n>` and counts the two words, so no allowed
  address reached the screen or this file.
* **Step 36's log** also shows the stop between the two starts was clean:
  `workspace: runner SIGTERM received: stopping` · `workspace: exiting 0`, then the firewall's lines
  again with `3 address(es)` for the pooler, then `runner started` and `db: connected as
  workspace_runner`.
* **The list's quoting check was not run again.** One line was added to the list today (step 27,
  `huggingface.co`): it is step 27's first line with another URL, and it was run as it stands.

### Task 12's checks

| task 12 check | list steps | result |
|---|---|---|
| `grep-clean`, the firewall's dry run (a) | 3 | pass: 13 of 13, 21 of 21 |
| the Dockerfile's literals; compose resolves; `sync` only without the profile; the rendered service; the `sync` hash (d) | 4, 6, 7, 8 | pass |
| the build, with the harness commit and the image's id and size | 9, 10, 11 | pass: harness `57ee51fc18ee4f7f367b60b24bfe39968d58d86b`; image `sha256:5790950804c5…77ae`, `1.66GB` |
| `up`, what it made, the firewall's log, healthy | 12 to 15 | pass |
| `claude --version` equals the pin; the help grep | 16 | pass: `2.1.289 (Claude Code)`, `6` |
| processes run as `node`; the runner's capabilities | 17, 18 | pass |
| `printenv ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` exits 1; `DATABASE_URL`; the five settings | 19 | pass |
| no published ports | 7, and 27's network read | pass: `ports` undefined; one network, `bb2dash-wt21_workspace-net` |
| the in-image layout; root's files; the CLI's folder | 20 to 22 | pass. The CLI's folder is `root:root`: the smoke passed with it so, and ruling T1's `--chown=node:node` exception was not needed |
| nothing can be planted where a turn loads project settings (ruling V2) | 23 | pass |
| the pins, the rules and the sets | 24, 25 | pass, after the fix round |
| the gate wiring: the hook command from the image's `settings.json`, exit 2 | 26 | pass |
| the firewall probes by name; `api.anthropic.com` answers | 27 | pass |
| the firewall probes by literal address | 27 (6080), 29 | pass |
| a second run of the firewall is refused | 30 | pass: 75, and nothing changed |
| ten connects to each database host; the connection verified against the pinned CA (ruling V2); one `search_context` over stdio | 31, 32, 33 | pass |
| the restart: healthy again, the marker made anew, the pins rewritten | 34 to 36 | pass |
| the token smoke (one Haiku turn), from `/app/turn` | 28 | pass: `ok`, `exit=0`. **The pinned CLI runs from a folder it cannot write** (ruling X4's question), and left nothing in it |

What the smoke settles that was open: the setup-token works inside a default-deny container
(Phase 14's A7 path, its first proof); `api.anthropic.com` on 443 is the only host the CLI needed
for a turn with `CLAUDE_CODE_DISABLE_NONESSENTIAL_TRAFFIC=1`, so `HTTPS_HOSTS` gains nothing and no
DECISIONS row is owed for a host; the CLI's install folder can stay root's. After the smoke the
volume holds seven names at its top, all `node`'s (`.claude.json`, `backups`, `policy-limits.json`
and its stamp, `projects`, `remote-settings.json`, `sessions`; six files in all, 108K), and a count
of files in it that hold a token, key, JWT or password-bearing DSN shape reads 0.

### Task 13's checks

| task 13 check | list steps | result |
|---|---|---|
| the guard before and after | 37, 40 | the same line at 05:36:02 and at 05:38:27 UTC |
| the exported filesystem scanned with gitleaks and the repo's config | 37, 38 | pass: `no leaks found`, `0` |
| the history scanned with gitleaks; the brief's grep | 39 | pass: `no leaks found`, `0`; the grep `0` |
| triage of hits | | nothing to triage: no hit, in the vendor trees or anywhere else. The allowlist was not touched |

The scan was of the image now running (`5790950804c5`). The scratch volume held 1.1G in 16,635
files: `/fs/app` with its six folders, `/fs/opt/fastembed`, and no `/fs/run/secrets` (the secrets
arrive at start, so the image has no such folder). gitleaks reads text: of that it scanned 80 MB,
passing over binaries and the three allowlisted base-image trees. The CLI's npm folder is not under
them (`/fs/usr/local/share/…` does not match `^/fs/usr/(include|lib|share)/`).

**The scan can fail.** A control, in a scratch folder outside every repo and not in the scan volume:
two files, each holding one made-up token of a shape gitleaks knows (random letters, no real
credential), one under `app/` and one under `usr/local/share/npm-global/`, scanned by the same
command with the same config:

```text
INF scanned ~112 bytes (112 bytes) in 129ms
WRN leaks found: 2
gitleaks exit=1
```

The scratch folder was removed afterwards. `w65-scan` was created, never started, and removed in the
line that exported it; `w65-scan-fs` was removed at step 40. Neither exists now.

### What is left running

* **`bb2dash-wt21-workspace-1`**, compose project `bb2dash-wt21`, service `workspace`: `running`,
  `healthy`, 0 restarts by Docker, started 2026-10-07T05:35:18Z (step 35's restart), on image
  `sha256:5790950804c5…77ae`. Its last three health probes at the last read each exited 0. It is
  connected to the database as `workspace_runner` and polling; no question was asked of it.
* Its network `bb2dash-wt21_workspace-net` and its volume `bb2dash-wt21_workspace-claude-home`.
* The image `bb2dash-workspace:local` and the build cache.
* Everything that was there before, untouched: `bb2dash-sync-1` (the guard), `bb2dash-harness-jobs-1`,
  `harness-postgres`, the two `bb2dash-mcp:local` containers. Nothing was pruned, and no `docker rm`,
  `docker volume rm` or `docker rmi` was run except the list's own two for the scan.

Only one tree at a time runs the test container, and it is this one's. Before the walks rebuild it
in `bb2dash-wt-21` (task 19, second half), step 41's two lines take this one down.

### What this run does not show

* **No question went through the runner.** The smoke ran the CLI directly. The first turn the runner
  itself makes (claim, begin, the CLI with its two MCP servers and the gate, stream, finish) is
  task 19's second half, the PM's.
* **The far side of migration 143.** It is not on production; the runner connected and reads
  healthy on this side of it.
* **`/usage`** was not read before or after the one turn.
* **The fix round's change was not reviewed** by anyone but this stream.
* **The model is baked, not that it never tries the network.** Step 33's search answered behind a
  firewall that refuses `huggingface.co` and `storage.googleapis.com`, so nothing was downloaded;
  whether the library attempts a request first and falls back was not read.

### Questions for the PM, second run

1. **The fix round (`f5ab661`, `defc566`): one condition in `resolve_once`.** A repeated A record is
   pinned and counted once. It was inside this stream's files and the Contract, so it was made
   without a ruling, as the run's rules allow; it is one of the two rounds. If the PM wants it
   reviewed before the walks, it is one condition and its comment in the script, and one test.
2. **The brief names one model host, and the model now comes from another.** Its task 12 (e) says
   "the same line for `https://storage.googleapis.com` → `blocked` (no model download is possible at
   runtime)". Since the harness moved to `fastembed` 2.1.1 the library downloads from
   `https://huggingface.co` (read in the image's own copy). The list keeps the brief's line and
   gained one for the new host; both read `blocked`. The brief's sentence is the PM's to change.
3. **The harness checkout on the host still has `fastembed` 2.1.0 installed**
   (`mcp-server/node_modules/fastembed/package.json`), under a `package.json` and lock that say
   2.1.1. The image is not affected: its `rag` stage runs `npm ci` from the lock and holds 2.1.1.
   The host's own rag server keeps using the old library and its old cache until someone runs
   `npm ci` there. That is the harness's, and Stack's or the PM's to do; nothing was changed.
4. **The CLI's layer is 492MB, not about 250MB.** The `COPY --from=cli` did not keep the package's
   link, so its one large binary is stored twice. The image works. Halving it is a change to how the
   stage hands the folder over, which was not tried here: say if it is wanted.
5. **Step 41 is owed.** The container, its network and its volume stay until the PM is done with
   this tree's container; the two lines are in the list.
6. **Other firewalls that pin or count an answer's lines** would read the same repeats from this
   resolver. bb2dash-stack's dev firewall, which this script was forked from, was not read for it in
   this run.
7. **The firewall test's address constants are real ones.** `docker/workspace/init-firewall.test.mjs`
   has held, since wave 1, the addresses the allowed names resolved to when it was written, and a
   count inside the container (a count, no address printed) reads that five of today's six pins
   equal them. They are public addresses of public services, in a test that dials nothing, and this
   file still writes every allowed address as `<address>`. If the PM would rather the test used the
   documentation ranges throughout, as today's new test does for its two new addresses, it is a
   change of five constants.
