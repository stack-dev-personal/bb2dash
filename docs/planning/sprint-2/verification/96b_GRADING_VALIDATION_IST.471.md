# 96b — V-1 grading validation: IST.471

Sitting date: 2026-09-29 · Export read: `96a_GRADING_SCHEMA_EXPORT_2026-09-29.md` · Syllabus: `bb_file:26` (`IST 471 Syllabus.pdf`; page n = unit n)

Other sources: `bb_file:61` (`Site Supervisor Evaluation.pdf`), `bb_file:59` (`form-internship-proposal-agreement-1.pdf`, the registrar's blank form). Stack's submitted proposal (`bb_file:141`) was read only to look for the grading-basis choice. The extraction does not show the checkbox, and none of its personal details are reproduced here.

Export §6 questions for this course: Q7 (letter scale stops at C-) is row IST.471-02 and IST.471-Q1.

## Amendments (PM, 2026-09-29)

* IST.471-02 (stored/value as prod's `letter_scale::text`: today's 8 steps, and after 106 the 12-step scale A 93 … D- 62, F 0 in prod's key order).
* IST.471-03 (ai_policy stored/value → null: prod's `grading_schemes.ai_policy` is null since migration 119_strip_ai_policy_passages, 2026-09-29).
* IST.471-04 (stored/value → false/true: the recheck is a `like` test; the notes text moved to `why`).
* IST.471-10 (stored/value → false/true: the recheck is a `like` test; the notes text moved to `why`).
* IST.471-11 (stored/value → false/true: the recheck is a `like` test; the notes text moved to `why`).

## Questions

* **id:** IST.471-Q1
* **question:** The syllabus scale stops at C- (≥ 71). What happens below 71?
* **what it blocks:** IST.471-02
* **evidence found:** `bb_file:26#unit:5`, scale runs "93- A 100" down to "71- C- 73"; nothing below
* **options:** (a) show "below C- (not on the syllabus scale)" with no letter; (b) extend the scale; (c) ask the professor
* **recommendation:** (a)
* **default if unanswered:** (a)
* **Stack's answer:** Figure out a scale for below with the ranges you do know. However this class is the class for my for-credit internship and I don't expect to get anything below a B. (Applied: the syllabus's 3-point step extended to D+ 68, D 65, D- 62, F below 62; `tentative` because derived.)
* **date:** 2026-09-29
* **DECISIONS row?:** no

* **id:** IST.471-Q2
* **question:** Letter grade or pass/fail?
* **what it blocks:** IST.471-02, IST.471-04
* **evidence found:** `bb_file:59#unit:1` "Letter grade (A-F) OR Pass/Fail (Undergrads Only)"; the extracted text of the submitted proposal does not show the choice
* **options:** (a) letter grade; (b) pass/fail
* **recommendation:** none; only Stack knows
* **default if unanswered:** (a), `tentative`
* **Stack's answer:** Letter grade.
* **date:** 2026-09-29
* **DECISIONS row?:** no
