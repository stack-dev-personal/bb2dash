# Sprint 2 — intake

Opened 2026-09-22 at sprint 1's close. Product manager: Stack. Method: the Phase 12b one
(`../sprint-1-hub/briefs/80c_PHASE12B_page_pass.md` §Method) — his list → one id per item → triage
→ one Sonnet researcher per area → ONE batch of questions with a default each → briefs → workers.
Migration range starts at **091**. Planning docs for this sprint live in this folder
(`briefs/`, `research/`, `verification/`, `evidence/`, `walks/`, `parked/`).

## Carried in from sprint 1 (PM's list; Stack adds his own below)

| id | area | item | source | size |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| S2-carry-1 | ingest | ~~Submission bytes are not pulled~~ **Fixed in the close-out PR (#25)**: `bb-sync` step 4b now runs `ingest/pull_files.mjs --bucket my_submissions`; rows 140 and 141 pulled, stored, extracted and embedded on 2026-09-22 | sprint 1 close-out | done |
| ~~S2-carry-2~~ | grades | V-1 grading validation still stubbed: 18 placeholders without points (21 on 2026-09-16), IST.323's 13-point proposal column ~~counts toward two parts~~ counts toward one part (the 11-point proposal, a "Counts toward…" link of 2026-09-22) and overfills it (corrected 2026-09-24), migration 059 held | `sprint-1-hub/briefs/63_GRADING_VALIDATION.md` | Stack's sittings + one data migration | **Closed by Phase 16 (2026-09-30): V-1 sat for all six courses; 106 reconciles (96d).**
| S2-carry-3 | harness | V-2 (R-27) is **built** in `~/agentic-harness` (its PRs #1–#4, 2026-09-16); the vault moved into git realms there on 2026-09-23/24 (its PRs #8–#15). Carried: bb2dash's acceptance walk of the 66 brief and the doc closure; the phase count here was an OneDrive-era figure, replaced 2026-09-30: after Phase 20's back-fill every indexed bb2dash session note carries a `phase` where one is derivable, and 534 of 636 read `''` because none is (equal to the back-fill's `phase_underivable_indexed`; `verification/101a_V2_VERIFICATION.md` D2) | `sprint-1-hub/briefs/66_SESSION_ARCHIVAL_RAG.md`; harness `docs/portable.md` | S (walk) + S (phase tags) | **Walked by Phase 20 (2026-09-30), `101a`; V-2 closed on Stack's word, 2026-09-30 (DECISIONS).**
| S2-carry-4 | containers | Phase 14 (R-28): brief + six research files ready; Stack places it in this sprint or after | `82_PHASE14_containers.md` | L | **Placed with Phase 15 by delegation (B-4, 2026-09-27); in flight since 2026-10-02 (brief 100).** |
| S2-carry-5 | planner | Deleting a series' last detached occurrence plainly leaves an empty `planner_event_series` row | `sprint-1-hub/walks/80o_PHASE12B_TAIL_WALK.md` W-3 | S (trigger) | **Fixed by Phase 15 (migration 102, 2026-09-29); orphan series 0 on prod 2026-10-03.** |
| S2-carry-6 | data | IST.466 publishes two content branches with identical paths; `bb_content` keeps one (P-data-1) | sprint 1 known issues | L (key change in `stage_content`) | **Fixed by Phase 19 (migrations 131, 139, 171; 2026-10-02/03): `bb_content` is keyed by Blackboard item and both IST.466 branches have rows.** |
| S2-carry-7 | styling | Phase 13 skipped; C-1 phone-width overflow, C-2 rank weights invisible, C-3 favicon | `parked/81_PHASE13_styling.md` | — |
| S2-carry-8 | db | 7 functions with a mutable `search_path` (advisor, pre-existing) | advisors | S | **Fixed by Phase 15 (migration 101, 2026-09-29); the advisor lists 0.** |
| S2-carry-9 | web | React #418 (hydration mismatch) in the console on every load of a `?item=assignment:…` popout URL (e.g. `/course/IST.471/classwork?item=assignment:IST.471/a1-proposal`); the plain page is clean. Same shape as the `/planner` one Phase 11b fixed with `useHydrated` (persisted query cache restored before the popout's first client render) | UX pass 2026-09-22 | S | **Fixed by Phase 17 (T-11, 2026-09-29): `ItemPopout` waits for hydration; spec 0 `/418/`.** |
| S2-carry-10 | web | ~~Direct load of `/course/[id]/assignment/…` was a 404~~ **fixed in PR #25** (`CourseAssignment` decided not-found on a pending, not-yet-fetching query — the server render); verified on the PR #25 preview 2026-09-22 (direct loads of the IST.471 and IST.352 pages render, submission block included) | UX pass 2026-09-22 | done |

## Stack's list (verbatim, filled by the PM session)

_Pending. Paste the list grouped however you like; the PM assigns ids `S2-<area>-<n>`._

## Triage → phases

_Filled after the list: each id gets a phase, a size (S/M/L), a research owner, and an MVP line in
Stack's words. Then the question batch, then one brief per phase under `briefs/`._
