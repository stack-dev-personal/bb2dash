/**
 * One retry schedule for the two calls that open and close a request's answer, `workspace_begin()`
 * and `workspace_finish()` (rulings V1, CR-2 and CR-3, and X1).
 *
 * A try that fails is made again after 1 s, then 2 s, 4 s, 8 s and every 15 s after that, for 110 s
 * from the first try; the last try is made as the 110 s end. A refusal the function raises itself
 * (SQLSTATE 22023) is an answer, not a failure: it ends the tries at once, and the end says whether
 * a failed try came before it. A statement the database refuses for what it is or holds (a data,
 * integrity or syntax SQLSTATE; ruling Z1, R2-5) ends the tries at once too: the same statement
 * gets the same answer. A statement cut at its time limit (57014) and every failure to reach the
 * database are tried again.
 *
 * The 110 s are read on the caller's monotonic clock (ruling Z1, R2-2): a step of the wall clock in
 * the middle of the tries neither ends them early nor adds to them.
