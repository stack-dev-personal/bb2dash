-- bb2dash :: db/migrations/187_inbox_apply_followups.sql
-- Phase 23 follow-ups (brief 110, frozen 2026-10-08; Stack's answers of that day). 180 to 186 stay
-- byte-frozen; this re-creates five functions, adds one table, four functions, one view and one
-- function for the acceptance run, and marks one test item.
--
-- WHY
--   1. An answer the apply worker cannot apply was handed to Claude again after every sync, each try
--      a run on Stack's plan (up to 12 a day). The worker now reports what it could not apply, the
--      database remembers it as a HOLD, and a sync files nothing for held answers alone. The hold is
--      a stored fact in a table no login can write (186 read the same fact from agent_requests,
--      which the owner's app login and the test login can write), and it is tied to the answer: it
--      stores the `resolved_at` the run was handed and holds only while the row still carries that
--      exact time, so no clock is compared and an answer given again is never held untried.
--   2. The decisions exporter could not file "notes only": the mark required both a vault note path
--      and a day-file path, and once a row was marked the later manual step could not find it. The
--      mark is now two steps (note, then log), and a decision can be marked skipped.
--   3. The acceptance run (acceptance/23) cannot answer Stack's own Inbox questions, and a proof may
--      not name `params` or `result`. It gets a function that raises four test questions of its own
--      through the owner's session, and a view with typed columns over the apply requests.
--
-- WHAT
--   Section 1, the hold
--     - table inbox_apply_holds (item_id, request_id, resolved_at, held_at): row level security on,
--       no policy, every privilege revoked from public, anon, authenticated and service_role, select
--       for the test login alone. Only inbox_apply_close writes it, with its owner's rights.
--     - inbox_apply_held_items(): the ids of the answered rows that have a hold for their current
--       answer and still need a reader (a row with applied_at set and no note needs none: the worker
--       records it without a run). SECURITY DEFINER, because the table grants nothing.
--     - re-created: sync_request_inbox_apply(bigint), inbox_apply_prepare(bigint),
--       inbox_apply_close(bigint, text, jsonb). Round 2 (brief 110): a press of Apply answers tries
--       held answers through its whole chain (a retry request: no trigger, or retry_held true); a
--       NEW hold is written by a failed close only; the failure notice also keeps 186's own arm, so
--       the old worker (no skip_seen, no hold) is no step back from 186
--   Section 2, filing in two steps
--     - re-created: inbox_decision_filed(bigint, jsonb)
--     - new: inbox_decisions_unlogged(integer), inbox_decision_logged(bigint, text),
--       inbox_decision_skipped(bigint, text); all four invoker rights, the service role's alone (and
--       the test login's, as 182's are)
--     - item 3782, the test item of the cut-over run, is marked skipped by this file's own guarded
--       statement (it has a logged write, which inbox_decision_skipped refuses, R5); on a database
--       without that row nothing is marked
--   Section 3, the acceptance objects
--     - view v_inbox_apply_runs: one row per inbox_feedback request, typed columns only
--     - inbox_accept_question(text, text): SECURITY DEFINER, authenticated only, owner check first
--   Section 4, a guard block that reads the privileges back
--
-- WHERE EACH RE-CREATED BODY CAME FROM (prod is byte-identical to the repo, so the live body is the
-- body of the last migration that created the function). Every change is marked `-- 187:`.
--     sync_request_inbox_apply   180 (no later migration re-creates it)
--     inbox_apply_prepare        185 (181's, then 185's)
--     inbox_apply_close          186 (181's, 185's, then 186's)
--     inbox_decision_filed       182 (no later migration re-creates it)
-- Signatures, argument names, return types, SECURITY DEFINER or invoker rights, the pinned
-- search_path and every existing grant are unchanged (`create or replace` keeps the grants). The
-- bodies keep the words `session_link` (185's pin) and `c_signed_in` (186's pin).
--
-- THE RUNNING WORKER. Between this file and the rebuild of the `apply` container, the old worker
-- runs on these functions: it ignores `held` and sends no `skip_seen`, so no hold is written and the
-- service behaves as it does today until the cut-over.
--
-- Additive in effect: no drop, no rename, no grant taken from a role that holds it.
