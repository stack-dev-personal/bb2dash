-- bb2dash :: db/migrations/143_workspace_review_round.sql
-- Phase 21 (docs/planning/sprint-2/briefs/102_PHASE21_workspace.md), the review round: rulings V3
-- and X2 on `/code-review main high` (CR-4, CR-7, CR-8) and on the note under `/security-review`
-- (docs/planning/sprint-2/verification/102a_PHASE21_VERIFICATION.md). Worker W-63.
--
-- WHY. The two reviews read 140 and 142 after they were applied. Those files are frozen (the repo
-- file stays byte-identical to what prod recorded), so the four changes the PM took are made here,
-- on top of them.
--
-- WHAT
--   1. v_workspace_status gains a last column, polled_age_seconds                        (CR-8)
--   2. workspace_finish refuses a request that is not claimed or cancelled      (security note)
--   3. workspace_claim's sweep also finishes an assistant row its request left behind    (CR-4)
--   4. the updated_at trigger fires only when the title or the session id changes        (CR-7)
--   5. a guard block, over the objects this file states and nothing else
--
-- ADDITIVE: `create or replace` only. No drop, no rename, no new object, no signature changed.
-- `create or replace` keeps an object's owner, its grants and its comment, so no grant is stated
-- again; section 5 re-reads who executes the functions, and the units re-read the view's grants.
-- Two things it does NOT keep, and they are stated again:
--   * a view's options. `create or replace view` replaces the options list with the one it is
--     given, even an empty one, so `with (security_invoker = true)` is written out below. Left
--     out, the view would run as its owner and show the heartbeat to every caller.
--   * a function's `security definer` and `set search_path`. They belong to the definition.
-- Each `comment on` below replaces a text that 140 or 142 wrote and that this file made wrong.
--
-- THE TWO FUNCTION BODIES are 142's, with only what is marked `143` changed: one constant and one
-- statement in workspace_claim, one refusal in workspace_finish.
--
-- No password, key or DSN is in this file.

-- `greatest` skips a null, so the null is kept by the `case`, not by the arithmetic.

-- turn is still on its way by then: the runner kills a turn 480 s after it starts and makes its
-- last finish try at most 110 s later (480 s + 110 s < 600 s), and the request was closed by a
-- Stop pressed during that turn, not before it. A finish that came later all the same would
-- still store its text: a cancelled request can be finished (section 2).

-- The boundary: `finished_at < now() - 10 minutes`, strictly. A request closed exactly 10 minutes
-- ago is left for a later poll; one closed any longer ago is swept.
