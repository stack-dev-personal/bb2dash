-- Phase 23 follow-ups (brief 110, Item 2; Stack's answer of 2026-10-08, "Stop re-asking superseded
-- files"). Re-creates the two functions every fold calls, each with its LIVE body and one change, as
-- 160 and 163 did before it. 122, 123, 160, 162 and 163 stay byte-frozen.
--
-- WHY
--   1. supersede_replaced_files asks one question when an item carries several files and one is new
--      (or when only a file name matches). It skipped the question only while a matching answer was
--      resolved or dismissed. /inbox-apply archives every answered row, so at the next fold the
--      settle test found nothing and the question was raised again. link_file_sessions had the same
--      flaw and 163 fixed it by also reading an archived row that did not close itself. This is the
--      same predicate (163:127-128), in the other function.
--   2. link_file_sessions writes Stack's pick onto the file and left the answer row as it was:
--      applied_at stayed null, so the queue row read was_applied = false. The apply worker therefore
--      carries a rule of its own that compares the file with the pick, the Inbox refuses Undo for
--      every session answer by its ref, and a session answer that the apply worker had to skip stays
--      held (187) because nothing says it was applied. The fold now ends by stamping applied_at on
--      every session answer whose pick is the session its file carries, however the file came by it
--      (R6). An answer of "none", or a pick the file does not carry, gets no stamp (the rule the
--      apply side keeps, 186:194-201).
--
-- WHAT
--   1. supersede_replaced_files(uuid, bigint): 160's body; the settle test also reads a row that is
--      archived and did not close itself. Nothing else changes.
--   2. link_file_sessions(bigint): 163's body; the function ENDS with one statement (the backfill's
--      own predicate, with dismissed as well): every session answer with no applied_at whose pick is
--      the session its current file carries is stamped. Step c itself is unchanged.
--   3. a backfill: every session answer (resolved or archived, not closed by itself, applied_at
--      null) whose pick is the session its current file carries is stamped. The count is printed.
--      The stamp's time is THIS MIGRATION'S, not the fold's that wrote the link: it says "applied
--      by the time 188 ran", and DATA_SYNTAX.md says so too. Re-running it stamps 0.
--   4. a guard block
--
-- WHERE EACH BODY CAME FROM (prod is byte-identical to the repo, so the live body is the body of the
-- last migration that created the function; found by searching db/migrations for each name):
--     supersede_replaced_files   160 (122's, then 160's; no later migration re-creates it)
--     link_file_sessions         163 (123's, 162's, then 163's; no later migration re-creates it)
-- Each change is marked `-- 188:` in the body. Signatures, SECURITY DEFINER, the pinned search_path
-- and the grants (service_role and db_test_runner; 122, 128, 162, 163) are unchanged.
--
-- APPLY AT THE CUT-OVER, AFTER `apply` IS REBUILT, NOT BEFORE: until the new worker runs, the old
-- one records a stamped session answer as "Applied by apply_resolutions()", the wrong function's
-- name. It is reviewed with 187 first and dry-run in one rolled-back transaction with no sync and no
-- apply request open (brief 110, task 6), so until the cut-over its unit reads "migration 188 is
-- not applied", on purpose, as phase23_183 did.
--
-- Additive in effect: no drop, no rename, no grant taken from a role that holds it; two bodies
-- replaced and one column (applied_at) stamped on rows that were applied.
