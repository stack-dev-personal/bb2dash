-- bb2dash :: db/tests/phase19_135_136_sync_driver.sql
-- Phase 19 (docs/planning/sprint-2/briefs/99_PHASE19_content_history.md), tasks 2, 12, 13 and 14.
-- Worker W-53. Tests migrations 135 (`sync_runs.interrupted_at`, the trigger
-- `agent_requests_open_sync_run`, `run_transform` adopting the row the trigger opened) and 136
-- (`transform_tick`: a registered run folds only on its calendar row; the terminal rule).
--
--   0. installed and shaped as the Contract freezes it; the premise for calling the tick here
--   1. 135: a claim that carries a run id opens exactly one `running` row, on update and on
--      insert, once; a claim with no run id, a `done` request and a `transform` request open none
--   2. 136: a registered run with a course row five minutes old and no calendar row is not folded,
--      and an unregistered crawl is not quarantined while a sync is in flight
--   3. 135 + 136: the same run with its calendar row is folded once, into the row the claim opened
--      (same id, `finished_at > started_at`, stage `history` recorded); the drain picks the newest
--      COMPLETE registered run, never a newer incomplete one; a second tick folds nothing
--   4. the installed (old) skill's order still folds: claim with no run id, crawl, then set run_id
--   5. 136's terminal rule: a `running` row 31 minutes old reads `failed` and interrupted, its
--      claimed request is closed and raises one Inbox item; a claimed request with no run id 31
--      minutes old is closed with one item; a 29-minute one and a fresh `running` row are left alone
--   6. a second tick adds nothing, and an interrupted run is never folded when its calendar row
--      arrives late
--   7. quarantine is unchanged: once no sync is in flight the unregistered crawl is recorded once,
--      and a registered incomplete run is neither quarantined nor folded by the idle rule
--   8. 135: a claim naming a quarantined run id is refused with 42501
--
-- Every fixture run id is `00000000-1953-4000-8000-…`, never a real crawl's, and every fixture
-- shell is `_w53fx…`, which resolves to no course, so a fold here reads no real course's payload.
-- RUN IT: `node scripts/db-test.mjs --only phase19_135_136_sync_driver.sql`, or paste the whole
-- file into one `execute_sql` call. A failing assertion raises; a pass ends with one summary row.
-- NOTHING IS COMMITTED: the file opens its own transaction and its last statement is `rollback`.
