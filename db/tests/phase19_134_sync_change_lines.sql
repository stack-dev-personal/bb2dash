-- bb2dash :: db/tests/phase19_134_sync_change_lines.sql
-- Phase 19 (docs/planning/sprint-2/briefs/99_PHASE19_content_history.md), task 10. Worker W-52.
-- Tests migration 134: sync_change_lines names up to three materials per change kind, from
-- p_stages->'history' (R-71), and carries every other sentence unchanged.
--
-- Blocks:
--   (1) the brief's fixture: exactly "2 new material(s): A, B" and
--       "1 material(s) no longer in Blackboard: C"
--   (2) more items than names: "5 new material(s): A, B, C (+2 more)"; a changed line;
--       a count with no sample says the count alone; a fourth sample name is not printed
--   (3) the two content-tree sentences are gone: content.inserted and content.missing say nothing
--   (4) zeros, a missing history stage, and a sample that is not an array say nothing and do not
--       raise
--   (5) every other sentence, fired at once with a different count each, comes back word for
--       word and in order, with the three material lines where the content lines used to be
--   (6) still immutable and invoker, search_path pinned, the P-72 convention in the comment,
--       grants as 051 left them (authenticated and service_role yes, anon no)
--
-- Pure function calls; nothing is written. RUN IT:
-- `node scripts/db-test.mjs --only phase19_134_sync_change_lines.sql`, or paste the whole file
-- into one `execute_sql` call. The last statement is `rollback`.
