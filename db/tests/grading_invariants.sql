-- bb2dash :: db/tests/grading_invariants.sql
-- Phase 16, R-32 / R-33. Standing checks on the grading rows the "graded so far" figure uses.
-- Not a test of one migration: every later phase reruns it (brief 96, §Tables and migrations).
--
--   A  weighted_pct scheme: top-level, non-extra-credit sum(weight_pct) = 100.
--   B  points scheme: top-level sum(points) = total_points, and the non-extra-credit sum
--      = graded_out_of.
--   C  a parent's non-extra-credit children sum to the parent, in the unit the parent uses
--      (points to points, weight_pct to weight_pct).
--   E  every component_id (assignments and grade_column_links) belongs to the scheme course,
--      coalesce(courses.parent_course_id, courses.id).
--   D  (ratchet) an assignment with points_possible > 0 and no component of its own sits under an
--      excluded grade_column_links row, or the grade model places its column (v_grade_model_items has
--      a row for the assignment's shell and bb_column_id with a component_id and not excluded: matched
--      by column, because the model's assignment_id is null when a column links several assignments),
--      or its id is in D_EXCEPTIONS. The
--      list only ever shrinks. The model is mirrored, not the raw link: it applies a link only to a
--      column in v_gradebook_latest of kind item or attendance (081, column_items), and it takes
--      the component from a non-excluded link first. Migration 106 folded links into
--      assignments.component_id only once, so a link made later never lands there.
--   F  (ratchet) confirmed rows that carry no citation (bb_file:<id>#unit:<n> or STACK_OVERRIDE):
--      schemes and components by notes, linked point-bearing assignments by source_ref (an
--      assignment whose column is "Not graded", an excluded grade_column_links row, counts toward
--      nothing, so the link row is its decision and it needs no citation: P-3, P-75).
--      F <= F_CEILING. The ceiling only ever goes down; 0 after 106. A column placed by the
--      Grades tab's picker is Stack's own override and carries no citation of its own.
--
-- Exact equality, no tolerance. Qualitative schemes are out of scope for A / B / C. Expected
-- sides come from grading_schemes / grade_components, never from v_grade_model_items.
--
-- RUN IT: node scripts/db-test.mjs --only grading_invariants.sql. It reads only; the final
-- rollback is the runner's lint rule.
