-- bb2dash :: db/tests/phase18_golden_truth.sql
-- Phase 18 (brief 98), task 22. Worker W-49. The eval's ground truth still holds on prod data:
--   * every truth file exists and is current (superseded_by is null)
--   * every truth text_id exists, belongs to one of the row's truth files, and contains the
--     row's answer_phrase
--   * a file-only truth (no text_ids) has at least one unit that contains the answer_phrase, and
--     names every current file of that course whose text carries it
-- Until 2026-10-09 Q7 asked for a date in a schedule the course re-posts about weekly, so its truth
-- (the schedule files by id) went stale at every re-post. On Stack's word it was replaced by a
-- question answered in two documents that have one version each (IST.466 files 21 and 39, units 88
-- and 101, "50 points"). The unit stays strict: when any truth file is superseded it fails and
-- names the file that replaces it ("Q7 file not current: <old id> -> <new id>, ..."); put the new ids in the
-- row AND in ingest/eval/golden_set.json (the eval scores by id through the search function, which
-- hides superseded files, so a stale id there misses silently). Q10 (the IST.323 AI-use disclosure) was
-- removed on 2026-09-29 by Stack's call to take the AI policy out of the app and the corpus (Phase 17
-- migration 119), not for its ranking.
-- The truth rows below are the same as ingest/eval/golden_set.json; ingest/eval_search.test.mjs
-- parses both and fails on any drift. Keep one truth row per line, in this exact shape.
-- Collects every failure and raises once. Writes nothing.
-- RUN IT: `node scripts/db-test.mjs --only phase18_golden_truth.sql`.
