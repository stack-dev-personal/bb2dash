-- bb2dash :: db/tests/phase12b_085_stage_attempts_v4.sql
-- Phase 12b, item G-7a (P-grades-4, P-grades-5). Tests migration 085: `stage_attempts` folds the
-- crawler v4 attempts chain, keeps the mime type Blackboard now gives us, leaves Stack's prose in
-- `raw` alone, and still folds a v3 payload without error.
--
-- RUN IT after the loader, in ONE transaction:
--   cat db/tests/phase12b_load_fixture.sql db/tests/phase12b_085_stage_attempts_v4.sql \
--     | psql "$DATABASE_URL"
-- or paste the same concatenation into one execute_sql call through the Supabase MCP. The loader
-- opens the transaction; this file's last statement is `rollback`, so nothing it writes survives.
