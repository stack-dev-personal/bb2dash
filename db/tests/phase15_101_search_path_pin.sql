-- bb2dash :: db/tests/phase15_101_search_path_pin.sql
-- Phase 15 (docs/planning/sprint-2/briefs/95_PHASE15_db_hygiene.md), task 14. Worker W-40.
-- Standing guards over the three security shapes this project has decided it wants, plus the
-- proof that pinning a search_path (101) did not change a single answer:
--
--   (a) every function in public resolves names against its OWN search_path, not the caller's
--   (b) every view in public is security_invoker, so RLS decides what it returns   (036)
--   (c) the only SECURITY DEFINER functions authenticated may execute are app_owner() and
--       calendar_push_now(); anon may execute none                                 (038, 068)
--   (d) under the most hostile caller path there is - an EMPTY search_path - the three retrieval
--       functions still answer. This is the guard that would have caught 101 being written with
--       the wrong value: `public, pg_temp` keeps them working, `pg_temp` alone would not.
--   (e) bb_file_relpath returns the same string under an empty path as under the default one
--   (f) calendar_push_now() refuses a uid that is not the owner. The lint-0029 WARN on it is
--       accepted (DECISIONS, Phase 15 row 1) BECAUSE of this guard, so the guard lives here.
--
-- (a) is first on purpose: it is the finding this file was written for, and its message is the
-- one the phase's RED check greps for.
--
-- RUN IT: `node scripts/db-test.mjs --only phase15_101_search_path_pin.sql`, or paste the whole
-- file into one `execute_sql` call. A failing assertion raises; a pass ends with one summary row.
-- The file writes nothing at all, and the last statement is `rollback`, so prod is untouched.
--
-- Values travel between statements in transaction-local GUCs (`set_config(..., true)`) rather
-- than a temp table: part of this file runs as `authenticated`, which holds no TEMP privilege,
-- and a GUC is rolled back with everything else.

-- Every value below is stored through `coalesce(…, '<null>')`. `set_config(name, NULL, true)` does
-- NOT store a null — it RESETS the GUC, and `current_setting` then yields `''`. Without the
-- sentinel, a null `bb_file_relpath` would make guard (e) compare `NULL is distinct from ''` and
-- raise although both paths agreed, and an empty `bb_files` would make `'' ::bigint` fail on a cast
-- rather than on the thing the guard is about. `<null>` cannot collide with a real value here: a
-- relpath always contains '/', a file id is digits, gcal_dirty is a boolean and search_path is set.

-- (a) No function in public resolves names against the caller's search_path
-- =============================================================================================
-- Extension-owned functions are excluded: pgcrypto, pg_net and the rest are not this project's
-- definitions, and the advisor does not count them either.
--
-- `d.classid = 'pg_proc'::regclass` is load-bearing, not decoration. `pg_depend.objid` is only
-- meaningful together with `classid` — oids are unique per catalogue, not across catalogues — so
-- without it ANY extension-dependent entry (a type, a relation, an operator) whose oid happens to
-- equal a function's oid would silently excuse that function from this guard. The exclusion would
-- then grow quietly wider every time an extension is installed.
--
-- MIGRATION 101 CARRIES THIS FLAW in its own one-time guard block and is left exactly as applied
-- (`db/migrations/101_search_path_pin.sql`, section 2): it has run, and on the catalogue of
-- 2026-09-27 its answer was right — the corrected predicate here counts the same 0. It is frozen
-- because the repo file must stay byte-identical to what was applied. **A future replay of 101
-- must not be trusted as a check**; this file is the authoritative standing guard for the rule.

-- =============================================================================================
-- (c) Which SECURITY DEFINER functions are on the API surface
-- =============================================================================================
-- Exactly two, both recorded: app_owner() because RLS policy evaluation needs it (DECISIONS
-- 2026-09-10), calendar_push_now() because it is owner-guarded inside, which (f) proves.
-- A third is allowed since migration 187 (section 3): inbox_accept_question(), granted to
-- authenticated alone, whose first statement refuses unless auth.uid() is app_owner();
-- db/tests/phase23_187_accept_objects.sql proves that refusal.
--
-- `p.proname || '()'` and NOT `p.oid::regprocedure::text`: regprocedure renders schema-qualified
-- whenever `public` is not on the caller's current path, so the same catalogue would compare as
-- `[public.app_owner(), public.calendar_push_now()]` and this guard would raise for no reason. That
-- is not hypothetical here - the file's own header offers "paste the whole file into one
-- `execute_sql` call" as a supported route, and migration 100 sets no `search_path` for
-- `db_test_runner`, so the rendering rests on a cluster default nobody in this repo controls.
-- The first two functions take no arguments, so `proname || '()'` is their full signature.
--
-- Phase 24a (migrations 190 and 194) adds four: workspace_upload_register, workspace_upload_retry,
-- workspace_document_delete and workspace_ask_with, the browser's four. Each is owner-guarded inside:
-- its first statement raises 42501 unless auth.uid() is the owner (phase24_190_store.sql and
-- phase24_194_ask_options.sql prove it). They are listed by name alone, like the first two.
