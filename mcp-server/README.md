# bb2dash materials MCP server

stdio MCP server that lets Claude Code search the harvested class-materials corpus —
syllabi, lecture slides, readings, assignment specs and rosters for the Fall 2026 courses —
by meaning and by keyword, and read any unit in full.

Three read-only tools: **`search_materials`**, **`get_material_text`**, **`list_courses`**.

Live corpus: **64 files / 534 text units / 1,195 `gte-small` embeddings across 7 courses**
(100% of units embedded). Hybrid search answers in ~0.6 s warm, ~1.5 s after the Edge
Runtime has been idle.

---

## How it works — the client never embeds

```mermaid

  A[Claude Code] -- stdio JSON-RPC --> B[bb2dash-materials]
  B -- "POST /functions/v1/search<br/>{ q, course, mode, limit, min_similarity }" --> C["Edge Function `search`<br/>Supabase.ai.Session('gte-small')"]
  C -- "hybrid_search_file_text(...)<br/>RRF over FTS + cosine, floor on the vector arm" --> D[(bb2dash Postgres<br/>bb_file_text + bb_text_embeddings)]
  D --> C --> B
  B -- "GET /rest/v1/bb_file_text?id=eq.N" --> D
  B -- formatted results --> A
```

The corpus was embedded **inside the Supabase Edge Runtime** with
`Supabase.ai.Session('gte-small')` (see `supabase/functions/embed-corpus`). The query must be
embedded by the same model with the same post-processing, or the cosine distances are
meaningless. So the query is embedded by the **same session in the same runtime**
(`supabase/functions/search`), and this process holds no model at all. Parity is guaranteed
by construction rather than verified after the fact — the opposite trade-off from the harness
`rag` server, which embeds locally and had to measure Node/Python agreement.

Ranked retrieval always goes through the SQL functions from migrations 010–012
(`search_file_text`, `match_file_text`, `hybrid_search_file_text`). Point reads (one unit, the
course list) go through PostgREST on `public`, which is exposed on this project.

### ⚠ There are two RAG stores. Never cross them.

|  | **bb2dash** (this server) | **harness-memory** (`rag` server) |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Project ref | `goultdzqcavefcgnifdy` | `hqkytnyiiuxovnnyixye` |
| Contents | Class materials | Session history by project/class |
| Model | `gte-small`, server-side | `bge-small-en-v1.5`, local fastembed |
| Dimensions | 384 | 384 |

Both are 384-dim, so pointing this server at the other project raises no error and returns
confidently-ranked nonsense. `loadConfig` refuses a `SUPABASE_URL` naming harness-memory.

---

## Setup

```powershell
cd C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash/mcp-server
npm install
npm run build
npm test
node scripts/smoke.mjs --env-file ../.env   # live end-to-end over stdio; never prints the key
```

Requires Node ≥ 20.11 (developed on 24.13.0). Pass `C:/...` paths to Node, never MSYS `/c/...`.

### Environment

| Variable | Required | Default | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `SUPABASE_URL` | **yes** | — | `https://goultdzqcavefcgnifdy.supabase.co`. Refused if it names harness-memory. |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_FILE` | one of these two | — | Path to a file holding the `sb_secret_…` key alone (a BOM, CR and LF are stripped). When set, it is the only source: it wins over `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE`, and a missing, unreadable, empty or multi-line file stops the server with a message that names the path, never the value. The image reads `/run/secrets/bb2dash_mcp_service_key`. |
| `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE` | one of these two | — | The `sb_secret_…` key itself. `SUPABASE_SERVICE_KEY` accepted as a legacy alias. Read only when `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_FILE` is unset. |
| `BB2DASH_MIN_SIMILARITY` | no | `0.78` | Cosine floor on vector evidence. `none` disables. |
| `BB2DASH_DEFAULT_LIMIT` | no | `10` | `limit` when the caller omits it. |
| `BB2DASH_MAX_LIMIT` | no | `50` | Hard ceiling on `limit`. |
| `BB2DASH_TIMEOUT_MS` | no | `30000` | Per-request timeout. |
| `BB2DASH_MAX_SEARCHES` | no | unset | Whole number. At most this many `search_materials` calls per server (one answering turn). Unset or empty: no limit, as before. |
| `BB2DASH_MAX_READS` | no | unset | Whole number. The same for `get_material_text`. |
| `BB2DASH_COURSES` | no | unset | Course ids separated by commas. With it, `search_materials` must name a course of the list; a read by id is not scoped. Unset or empty: no scope. |

The last three are set by the Workspace runner in the per-request MCP config (Phase 24a). A call
past its limit, or outside the scope, comes back as an **error result** (`isError`), never a
protocol error, so the turn goes on. A refused search uses nothing up. Counts live in the process,
one server one budget.

**Why the service key.** `bb_file_text` and `bb_text_embeddings` are readable only by
`authenticated`/service (anon is insert-only, by design — NOTES.md caveat 9), and `search` runs
behind `verify_jwt`. This is a local stdio process driven by Claude Code, never a browser, so the
key stays server-side. It lives in one file, the `bb2dash_mcp_service_key` secret in the secrets
folder (`SECRETS_DIR`, on this laptop `C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets/`), and nowhere in the
repo, an image or `~/.claude.json`.

### Register with Claude Code (Docker)

MCP servers are **not** read from `~/.claude/settings.json`; user-scope servers live in
`~/.claude.json` and are written with the `claude mcp` CLI. The registration runs the
`bb2dash-mcp:local` image once per session and names the key file by path, so neither the
command line nor `~/.claude.json` nor `docker inspect` holds the key.

1. Build the image (once, and after each change under `mcp-server/`), from the repo root:

   ```powershell
   docker compose --profile mcp build bb2dash-mcp     # or: docker build -t bb2dash-mcp:local mcp-server
   ```

2. Write the key file **before** the first run. Docker Desktop on Windows turns a missing bind
   source into an empty folder, even with `--mount`; if that happened, delete the folder first.

   ```powershell
   & C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets/set-secret.ps1 bb2dash_mcp_service_key   # hidden prompt
   ```

3. Register it (PowerShell; the `--mount` value is quoted because it holds commas):

   ```powershell
   claude mcp remove bb2dash -s user      # only if an older registration exists
   claude mcp add --scope user bb2dash -- docker run -i --rm `
     --mount "type=bind,source=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets/bb2dash_mcp_service_key,target=/run/secrets/bb2dash_mcp_service_key,readonly" `
     -e SUPABASE_URL=https://goultdzqcavefcgnifdy.supabase.co `
     -e SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_FILE=/run/secrets/bb2dash_mcp_service_key `
     bb2dash-mcp:local
   claude mcp list        # bb2dash: docker run -i --rm ... - ✓ Connected
   ```

   From Git Bash, prefix the `claude mcp add` line with `MSYS_NO_PATHCONV=1`, or MSYS rewrites
   `/run/secrets/...` into a Windows path.

The same run through compose, with the secret and the URL from `compose.yaml`:
`docker compose --profile mcp run --rm -T bb2dash-mcp` (from the repo root, with `SECRETS_DIR`
set). Without Docker, the host build reads the same file:
`claude mcp add --scope user bb2dash -e SUPABASE_URL=https://goultdzqcavefcgnifdy.supabase.co -e SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_FILE=C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets/bb2dash_mcp_service_key -- "C:/Program Files/nodejs/node.exe" C:/Users/stack/projects/bb2dash/mcp-server/dist/index.js`.

### Smoke test

```powershell
node scripts/smoke.mjs --env-file ../.env                                   # host build, live
node scripts/smoke.mjs --docker --key-file C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets/bb2dash_mcp_service_key   # the image, live
node scripts/smoke.mjs --docker --key-file <any non-empty file> --tools-only # startup and tool listing only
```

`--docker` runs the image exactly as the registration does (`--image` overrides
`bb2dash-mcp:local`; `--key-file` defaults to `$SECRETS_DIR/bb2dash_mcp_service_key`). The live run
calls all three tools against the corpus; `--tools-only` needs no network and no real key. The
script never prints a key and exits 0 only when every check passes.

After restarting Claude Code the tools appear as `mcp__bb2dash__search_materials`,
`mcp__bb2dash__get_material_text` and `mcp__bb2dash__list_courses`. Diagnostics go to stderr;
stdout is JSON-RPC only.

## Tools

### `search_materials`

| Parameter | Type | Required | Default | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `q` | string, 1–2000 chars | yes | — | Embedded server-side and passed verbatim to full-text search. |
| `course` | string | no | all | Exact course id from `list_courses`, e.g. `IST.323`. Case-sensitive. |
| `mode` | `hybrid` \| `vector` \| `fts` | no | `hybrid` | `vector` returns full unit text; `fts` is keyword-only with no similarity. |
| `limit` | integer 1–50 | no | 10 | |
| `min_similarity` | number 0–1 | no | 0.78 | Floor on the semantic evidence. Never gates literal keyword hits. |
| `include_superseded` | boolean | no | `false` | Include files a newer upload has superseded (several dated copies of one schedule / roster exist). Sent to the function only when `true`. |

**Example** (real output, trimmed):

```
3 results for "CIA triad confidentiality integrity availability" (all courses, mode hybrid, top 3).
Judge relevance by `similarity` — real cosine from gte-small, where on this corpus relevant
material scores ~0.83–0.92 and unrelated ~0.75–0.77. `score` is a Reciprocal Rank Fusion sum: it
sets the ordering and is not a percentage.

### 1. Lecture_1-PropertiesTrends-Fall2026.pptx
- course: IST.323
- bucket: lecture_slides
- unit: slide 3
- text_id: 400
- file_id: 7
- similarity: 0.9199
- score: 0.039216 (RRF, ordering only)
- excerpt: matched passage

Information Security PropertiesThe CIA Triad …
```

#### Two scores, two meanings

- **`similarity`** is real cosine and is interpretable in absolute terms. Measured 2026-09-09
  over the live corpus (best hit, `mode=vector`):

  | Query class | Best-hit similarity |
  | --- | --- |
  | Relevant, 5 course-specific queries | 0.830 – 0.920 |
  | Nonsense English (bread, bike tire, football) | 0.753 – 0.767 |
  | Gibberish (`asdf qwerty zxcv`) | 0.818 — attracted to a roster spreadsheet |

  gte-small's range sits higher than bge's because every stored part carries a
  `{course} {bucket} — {file}: ` header. The **0.78** default clears every real-English nonsense
  hit and sits under every relevant one; gibberish is the known gap.
- **`score`** is a raw RRF sum with ceiling `2/(k+1) ≈ 0.039` at `k=50`. Ordering only.

#### An empty result is a valid answer

With the floor applied server-side, `"banana bread recipe with walnuts"` returns **nothing**,
and the message says so plainly with `isError` false. The floor gates the vector arm only: a unit
that matched the query terms literally still comes back, with its real similarity and a label
(`below the 0.78 floor — surfaced by literal keyword match`).

If the deployed `search` function ever predates the floor (v2), the server says so in the result
header and labels sub-floor hits rather than removing them; the client works with either version.

An empty result with a `course` filter lists the course ids that actually exist, because a
mistyped id (`IST323`) and an empty topic look identical otherwise.

#### What the excerpt is

Every hit carries an `- excerpt:` line saying where the text below it came from:

The label depends on the mode first, because the three modes return different things:

| Mode | Label | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `fts` | `keyword headline over the whole unit` | `ts_headline` over the unit text; this mode does no part slicing |
| `vector` | `full unit text` | the whole unit; `— part N matched` names the part the query vector was nearest to |
| `hybrid` | `matched passage` | the passage the snippet was cut from — a headline over the matching part, or the head of that part |
| `hybrid` | `matched passage (part 3)` | the same, cut from part 3; the part is named only from part 2 on |
| `hybrid` | `unit head — the start of the unit …` | no passage evidence, so only the head of the unit is shown |
| `hybrid` | `unit head (older server) …` | the response carried no `snippet_source`, i.e. the backend predates migration 021 |

Where the label is not `matched passage`, read the whole unit with `get_material_text` before
concluding something is absent from it.

#### Superseded files

Blackboard holds several dated copies of some files (four `IST466M3 Schedule …` versions, two
rosters). `bb_files.superseded_by` chains the stale ones to the current version, and search skips
them unless `include_superseded` is `true`. Ask for them only to inspect the history — quoting a
stale schedule is worse than finding nothing.

#### Speaker notes

PPTX extraction inlines the professor's speaker notes behind a `[notes]` marker. Any excerpt or
unit containing it is flagged; treat that text as private instructor commentary, not slide
content.

### `get_material_text`

| Parameter | Type | Required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `text_id` | positive integer, from a search result | yes |

Returns the full unit with file name, course, bucket, Blackboard path and character count. A
missing id is an empty result, not an error.

### `list_courses`

No arguments. Returns the seven course ids with short titles — the exact strings the `course`
filter accepts.

---

## The search function

`supabase/functions/search/index.ts` is **v3, deployed 2026-09-09**: it accepts `min_similarity`,
forwards it to `hybrid_search_file_text` (migrations 012–013), filters and de-duplicates `vector`
results per unit, echoes the floor in the response so the client knows it was applied, rejects
malformed bodies with 400, and logs failures in full server-side while returning only a code to the
caller. Omit `min_similarity` and it behaves exactly like v2. To redeploy after a change:

```powershell
supabase functions deploy search --project-ref goultdzqcavefcgnifdy
```

or the Supabase MCP `deploy_edge_function` tool (`verify_jwt: true`).

---

## The batch entry (Workspace runner only)

`dist/batch.js` is **not an MCP tool**: `server.ts` still registers exactly three, so host sessions
and the apply container gain nothing. The Workspace runner starts it once per question with the
same two environment values the server gets, writes one JSON object on stdin and reads one on
stdout (`workspace/test/fixtures/contract24/batch-request.json`, `batch-answer.json`):

```powershell
echo '{"version":1,"queries":[],"attachments":[]}' | node dist/batch.js
```

* Per query: `ok` and its hits, each with its `kind` (`material`, `upload`, `memory`), from the
  `workspace-search` edge function. State `ok`; `refused` (the function answered 4xx); `failed`
  (anything else, the 8 s limit of each call included).
* Per attachment: what `workspace_attachment_read` returned (cut on the server). A read that fails
  keeps its place with state `failed` and zero counts.
* A hit is data. Nothing in a passage is read as an id, a label or another hit.
* The project is read through `loadConfig`, as the server does, so the vault's project is refused
  before any request. Exit 0 whenever the object was written; 1 only when none could be (bad
  stdin, bad configuration). Stdout holds the object alone; stderr holds states, counts and
  timings, never a query or a passage.

---

## Error handling

Every failure carries a `Fix:` line. Configuration problems are fatal at startup; everything else
is an MCP tool error the model can read.

| Situation | Behaviour |
| --- | --- |
| `SUPABASE_URL` / key missing | Exits 1 naming the variable. |
| `SUPABASE_URL` names harness-memory | Exits 1 — different vector space, would fail silently. |
| 401 / 403 | Tool error: the key must be the `sb_secret_…` service key. |
| 404 on `/functions/` | Tool error: deploy the `search` function. |
| 500 from the function | Tool error carrying the function's own message, code and hint. |
| Timeout | Tool error naming `BB2DASH_TIMEOUT_MS`. |
| Malformed row | Tool error — a schema drift never reaches the model as empty fields. |
| No results | **Not an error.** |
| Unit not found | **Not an error.** |
