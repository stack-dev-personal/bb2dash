/**
 * The service key arrives as a file; the registration names only its path.
 *
 * `claude mcp get` prints a server's env block in clear text, and `docker
 * inspect` prints a container's environment the same way, so a key placed in
 * either is a key on every screen that shows it. The registration therefore
 * carries `SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_FILE` (a path: `/run/secrets/...` inside the
 * image, the compose secret `bb2dash_mcp_service_key`) and the server reads the
 * file itself at start. Ported from agentic-harness `mcp-server/src/env-file.ts`
 * (the secret-by-path rule; there the path names a `.env`, here the file holds
 * the one key).
 *
 * Unlike the harness's optional `.env`, a named key file is required: missing,
 * unreadable, empty or multi-line each stop the server with a message that names
 * the variable and the path. No message ever carries the file's content.
