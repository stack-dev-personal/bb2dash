# bb2dash — session guide

Blackboard Ultra → Supabase → personal academic hub. Syracuse, Fall 2026. Owner: Stack.
Supabase project: `goultdzqcavefcgnifdy` (us-east-1, Postgres 17). Full access via Supabase MCP.

## Read first

0. **PM sessions:** run `/bb2dash-pm` — it loads `project-state/ORCHESTRATOR.md` (phase map,
   execution order, the per-phase cycle, and the ordered review list) before anything else.
1. `project-state/STATUS.md` — where the product is, what's done, what's next. **Start here.**
2. `project-state/DECISIONS.md` — why things are the way they are. Don't relitigate silently.
3. `DATA_SYNTAX.md` — data dictionary, ID conventions, enums, search layer.
4. `docs/planning/sprint-0-foundation/40_RECONCILIATION_2026-09-09.md` — how the local planning round and the
   cloud work were reconciled; `gui research context/gui/README.md` — the GUI layout spec.

## Workflow SOP (Stack's rules — follow them)

* Develop on branches (`feat/`, `fix/`, `chore/`, `docs/`); never commit directly to `main`.
* Commit + push to the working branch as each task completes, not batched at the end.
* **One PR per phase.** Merge to `main` / deploy to prod ONLY when Stack explicitly asks in
  that conversation — otherwise stop at "ready when you say so."
* **Anything visual:** get it in front of Stack before merging — a dev server URL locally, or
  a Vercel preview deployment from a cloud session — and wait for his OK.
* **Upon each PR: update `project-state/STATUS.md`** (what shipped, where the product is,
  what's slotted next) **and append new decisions to `project-state/DECISIONS.md`**, in the
  same PR.
* Migrations are additive and numbered (`db/migrations/NNN_name.sql`); apply to prod via
  `mcp__Supabase__apply_migration` with the same name, and keep the repo file byte-identical
  to what was applied. Never let repo and prod drift (it happened once; see AUDIT doc).
* Substantial new scope: put open questions to Stack before building; he verifies before
  development begins.

## Project facts

* Facts live in `assignments`; Stack's planner state lives in `assignment_progress` /
  `reading_progress` and is **never overwritten by syncs** — one sanctioned exception (Phase 12b):
  a newly posted or changed Blackboard score advances `assignment_progress.status` to `graded`,
  forward-only, never from excused or DNF. A second, narrower path: `/inbox-apply` (since Phase 23
  run by the `apply` container after a sync and from the Inbox's "Apply answers" button; before
  that as `bb-sync` step 0) has written `assignment_progress` from Stack's answered Inbox items (scores,
  notes, one inserted row; `docs/inbox-decisions/2026-09-22.md`, `2026-09-23.md`); sanctioned
  narrowly on 2026-09-27 (DECISIONS, batch item 59): only rows named in an Inbox item Stack answered
  himself, status only when his words say so, scores as Blackboard shows them, every write in that
  day's log (since Phase 23: in `inbox_apply_writes` when it is made, and in the day file once the
  exporter has run). `reading_progress` has no such path. Status values and labels live in `web/src/lib/progress-status.ts`.
* Grades show one deterministic figure, "graded so far" (`web/src/lib/graded-so-far.ts`), computed
  only from mirrored Blackboard scores, `grade_components` and column links; what it leaves out is
  named under it. No what-if, no projections.
* Blackboard ingest runs inside a logged-in Blackboard Ultra tab (`ingest/bb_crawler.js`)
  → `bb_raw` → SQL transforms populate typed tables. See `PHASE2_FINDINGS.md` and the
  ingest cadence runbook.
* `course context/` holds professors' materials and is gitignored on purpose. The skill-side copy
  into it (`bb-sync` step 4b, `ingest/pull_files.mjs`) is sanctioned; the declined OneDrive mirror
  (v3 §4 D-7) is Phase 12's dropped desktop mirror, not this copy.
* Desktop shell (Phase 12): the Sync button **runs** `claude "/bb-sync <id>"` in Windows Terminal,
  and the shell's session is the web app's cookie in the `persist:bb2dash` partition. Requirements
  v2's R-13 "opens the terminal with the command ready" and R-23 "session in `safeStorage`" were
  superseded on 2026-09-16 (DECISIONS).
* Retrieval: hybrid mode of the `search` edge function is the default (see EVAL doc).
  Search UIs must scrub/label PPTX `[notes]` speaker-note markers and `Page N` headers.
* GUI: layout spec = the Nocturne artboards; CSS Modules + custom properties, no Tailwind.
  No fabricated numbers anywhere — no grade display until real gradebook data exists.
* Workspace (Phase 21): a chat page at `/workspace`. A container runner answers each question with one
  `claude -p` turn of the pinned CLI (2.1.289) on Stack's Claude subscription: no API key, never `--bare`,
  never the Agent SDK. A heuristic router picks Haiku, Sonnet or Opus. **v1 is read-only**: the assistant's
  tools are off, four read tools over the materials and the two bb2dash notes collections pass a gate, and
  the runner's database login cannot reach planner state (`assignment_progress`, `reading_progress`) or a
  fact table. Migrations 140–143 are frozen; a fix is a new migration in 144–149.
* Inbox auto-apply (Phase 23): after a sync that closed done, the `sync` container files an
  `inbox_feedback` request when the Inbox's answered queue holds an answer that is not held (187: an
  answer a run could not apply is a row of `inbox_apply_holds`, which only `inbox_apply_close` writes; a
  sync does not try it again, a new answer or a press of Apply answers does); the `apply` container's worker
  (`apply/`) claims it, records the rows that need no reading itself, and runs `/inbox-apply` with one
  `claude -p` run for the rest. It writes as the role `inbox_apply_runner`, which can write only
  `assignments`, `assignment_progress`, `course_staff` and `courses.group_notes`, each write logged against
  an answered Inbox item (181). The decision is stored on the archived row first; the vault note is
  rendered from it by the scheduled export (`scripts/exports-run.mjs --notes-only` under the Windows task
  `Bb2dash-Exports`, registered at the follow-ups' cut-over by `scripts/register-exports.ps1`; a failed
  export shows on `just doctor` only), and `docs/inbox-decisions/<date>.md` with its pull request by
  `scripts/inbox-decisions-pr.mjs` on the host, by hand (`just file-decisions`). A decision whose item has
  a logged write is never skipped.
  The sync still holds no LLM (B-43). Claude's SQL there is two tools: `query` (one select, in a read-only
  transaction) and `apply_item` (one item; the server runs the transaction and checks each statement against
  an allow-list). Migrations 180–188 are frozen (183 went on at the cut-over, 2026-10-07; 187, the follow-ups'
  apply side, on 2026-10-09; 188, where the transform reads an archived superseded-file answer and the fold
  stamps `applied_at` on a session answer whose pick its file carries, at the follow-ups' cut-over the same
  day); a fix is migration 189, the one number left. Since 185 the role also reads `bb_files` (21 columns, never `source_url`,
  `local_path` or `sha256`) and `sessions`, and writes neither: a session answer (`session_link/<file id>`)
  is `link_file_sessions`'s to apply, and the worker records it only when the file already shows it. Since 107 (2026-10-09)
  the role also reads `grade_column_links` (select only), because `v_gradebook_latest`, which it already read,
  now takes its "counts toward" flag from the Grades tab's picker.

## Environment gotchas (cloud sessions)

* Sandboxed sessions **cannot reach `*.supabase.co`** (org egress policy 403s CONNECT).
  Invoke edge functions server-side instead: `select net.http_post(...)` via
  `mcp__Supabase__execute_sql`, then read `net._http_response`. pg_net is enabled for this.
* Edge functions: `verify_jwt` is on — use the legacy anon JWT, not the `sb_publishable_` key.
  Exception: `calendar-push` runs with `verify_jwt` off and authenticates the tick's
  `x-push-secret` header from Vault (Phase 11); nothing else calls it.
* Edge CPU budget ≈ 8–9 embedding parts per invocation; `embed-corpus` is resume-safe per part.
* Secrets: service key never in a browser or the repo; publishable/anon key is fine
  client-side (RLS is the boundary). Since Phase 14 (R-28) the sync runs in Docker: the `sync`
  container (`compose.yaml`, `docker/sync/`, `sync/`) holds Blackboard's login, logs in through
  `http://127.0.0.1:6080/vnc.html`, and reaches the database only as the `sync_runner` role through its
  SECURITY DEFINER functions (091, 093). Secrets live in `SECRETS_DIR` (`C:/Users/stack/.bb2dash-secrets/`),
  outside every repo; the service key's only home is `bb2dash_mcp_service_key` there. Never
  `docker compose up` or recreate `sync` while a sync is open, and never touch the `bb-profile` volume (it is
  the login). The Windows `/bb-sync` skill stays the fallback. Keep OS-bound code behind thin adapters.
* Apply service (Phase 23): `apply` in `compose.yaml` sits behind `profiles: [apply]`, on its own network
  `apply-net`, and mounts neither `bb-profile` nor `course-files`: a Claude process never shares a network
  or a volume with the Blackboard login (`docker/apply/image.test.mjs`). Its secrets are files:
  `inbox_apply_db_url` (the role's session-pooler DSN), `claude_oauth_token` and `bb2dash_mcp_service_key`
  (read by the materials server only). Its firewall is generated from the Workspace's
  (`node docker/apply/fork-firewall.mjs --write` after that script changes). Start, restart and rebuild it
  alone (`docker compose up -d --build apply`), never through a bare `up` while a sync is open.
  bb2dash-stack's `.env` names the profile from the follow-ups' cut-over on (`COMPOSE_PROFILES=workspace,apply`,
  Stack's line), and its doctor has an `apply` row and an `exports` row. A test build never takes the live
  tag `bb2dash-apply:local`: it is built under a tag of its own through a second compose file. Phase 23 is
  accepted by `just accept 23` (pack `acceptance/23/`), which stops and starts `apply` alone.
* Workspace service (Phase 21): `workspace` in `compose.yaml` sits behind `profiles: [workspace]`, so a plain
  `up` never starts it; bb2dash-stack's `.env` turns it on (`COMPOSE_PROFILES=workspace`, acceptance step 13).
  From bb2dash-stack it is started, restarted and rebuilt alone (`docker compose up -d --build workspace`,
  `docker compose restart workspace`); `just up` rebuilds every service and is never run while a sync is open
  (DECISIONS 2026-10-07). On the phase branch, before the merge, it runs only as compose project `bb2dash-wt21`
  from a phase worktree, the service named in every command. Its runner reaches the database only as the login
  role `workspace_runner`, through five
  SECURITY DEFINER functions (`workspace_claim`, `workspace_begin`, `workspace_stream`, `workspace_finish`,
  `workspace_heartbeat`; 142, 143), and the service mounts four secrets from `SECRETS_DIR` as files:
  `workspace_runner_db_url`, `claude_oauth_token`, `bb2dash_mcp_service_key`, `harness_database_url` (the
  last two could write; each is read only by its own MCP server, accepted for v1, DECISIONS 2026-10-05).
