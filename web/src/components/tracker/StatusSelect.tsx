/**
 * The status quick-edit (T-06). Lifted out of Today.tsx so the tracker's detail
 * panel, the undated tray and the assignment popout all offer the same control
 * instead of three copies drifting apart.
 *
 * It writes nothing itself: the owner supplies `onChange` and the pending flag,
 * because the mutation (and its optimistic patch) belongs to the screen.
 *
 * S-1 (P-grades-7): the vocabulary is `@/lib/progress-status` and nowhere else.
 */

/**
 * The options every status menu in the app offers: the six, in Stack's order,
 * plus — only when the row holds one — a disabled entry for a retired value.
 *
 * That last one matters. The Postgres enum keeps its nine values (migrations
 * are additive), and until migration 078 folds the rows, `assignment_progress`
 * still holds `planned`, `waived` and `not_applicable`. A controlled <select>
 * whose value matches no option renders as its FIRST option — so a `waived` row
 * would have silently displayed "not opened", and the first time Stack touched
 * anything on that row it would have been written as such. The disabled entry
 * makes the control show the value's fold ("excused") and offer no way to
 * choose it, so nothing is rewritten by being looked at.
