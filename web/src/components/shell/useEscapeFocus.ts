/**
 * Escape puts focus back on the button that opened a panel (Phase 22, task 32; D-4).
 *
 * `usePopover` closes on Escape and returns no focus (R-51), and keeps that shape. A panel that
 * wants focus back says so with this hook: while it is open, an Escape moves focus to its own
 * button. An outside press is not Escape: the press puts focus where the pointer went.
 *
 * Only an Escape that belongs to this popover moves focus (round 2, R2-8): focus is inside the
 * popover's anchor (its button and its panel) or nowhere. An Escape pressed in another widget, the
 * search field with this popover still open, is that widget's, and it needs the focus where it is.
