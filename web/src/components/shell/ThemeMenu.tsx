/**
 * The theme rows of the account menu (Phase 22, task 10; P-77): Dark, Light and
 * Auto, in that order, as three `menuitemradio` rows in one group.
 *
 * Dark is checked while nothing is stored. A pick stamps `html[data-theme]` and
 * every `theme-color` meta (with the two-frame switching mark, so nothing eases
 * through the flip) and then writes or removes the key: Dark removes it, Light
 * writes `light`, Auto writes `auto` and stamps what the system says. All of that
 * is in `lib/theme-preference.ts`, beside the boot script that reads the same key.
 *
 * It only adds `menuitemradio` rows: `TopNav.update.test.tsx` asserts the exact
 * list of `menuitem` rows, and these are not that role.
 *
 * Storage is read through `useSyncExternalStore`, as `ActivityMenu` does, so the
 * server and hydration see Dark and every render after sees the stored choice;
 * this menu is only mounted while the account menu is open, which is after
 * hydration. A storage that throws still stamps the page: what was picked in this
 * mount is kept beside the stored value, so the checked row follows the pick, and
 * a later change of the stored value from another tab (the `storage` event) wins
 * over it. The page itself follows that tab through the boot script's listener.
