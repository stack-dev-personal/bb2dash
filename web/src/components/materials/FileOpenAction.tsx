/**
 * The one Open ladder.
 *
 * Four screens show a file and a way to reach it — the Materials browser, the
 * course Info tab's syllabus, the session popout, and the Classwork tree — and
 * each had hand-copied the same three-rung ladder with its own labels and its
 * own button classes. The same unreachable file read "No route" on one screen,
 * "no route" on another and "on disk only" on a third, and a file with a
 * source URL opened through a primary button on two screens and a secondary
 * one on the third. This component is the ladder; the callers supply the row.
 *
 * The rungs, in order:
 *
 *   1. bytes in the `bb-files` bucket  → a signed-URL open (OpenStoredButton)
 *   2. a recorded source URL           → that link, in a new tab
 *   3. a Blackboard page the caller    → "In Blackboard ↗" (the Classwork tree
 *      offers as a fallback              passes the content item's own URL)
 *   4. nothing reachable               → a disabled control that says which
 *                                        kind of nothing it is
 *
 * Rung 4 is a disabled button rather than nothing at all, because a row with no
 * action looks like a row that failed to render. `fileHonesty` decides what it
 * says — including the "Not stored" case, where the caller could only see
 * `storage_path` and must not claim there is no source link.
