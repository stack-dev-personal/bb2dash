/**
 * /planner — the week grid (R-19, Phase 11).
 *
 * Monday → Sunday columns, 08:00–22:00 in half-hour rows, an Assignments band
 * above them (the all-day band, so named because that is what Stack puts in it)
 * and, beneath it, the Events band for all-day planner events (Phase 11b). Class meetings come from `meetings` (expanded by wall clock, with the
 * room and, when a `sessions` row covers that course and day, its topic); due
 * items come from the same `v_work_items` window Today reads, so a status
 * changed here and a status changed there are the same fact in the same caches.
 *
 * No drag, no day view, no work-window lane (Stack, 2026-09-14). Two kinds of
 * write: the status quick-edit on a due item (`StatusSelect` plus
 * `useSetItemStatus`, the Today mutation, so it can only reach
 * `assignment_progress` / `reading_progress`), and planner events (Phase 11b):
 * an empty slot or Events cell opens `PlannerEventForm`, a planner-event block
 * opens it in edit mode, and a task's checkbox writes `planner_events.done`.
 * Those reach `planner_events` only.
 *
 * `?week=YYYY-MM-DD` is the Monday anchor, so a week is linkable and ◂ ▸ are
 * plain links rather than state. The parameter is untrusted: `weekAnchor`
 * validates it and falls back to the current week rather than throwing.
 *
 * This file is the screen: the header, the states, the one write the band's
 * toggle makes, and what it hands the board. The board itself is
 * `PlannerBoard`; the queries and the placement are in `usePlannerWeekData`;
 * the week arithmetic is in `@/lib/planner-week` and the row geometry in
 * `@/lib/planner-rows`, neither of which has React in it; one block's content
 * is in `PlannerItem`. Nothing here invents a position: a date-only item sits
 * in the band because that is what is recorded, and so does a timed one whose
 * clock falls outside the drawn hours.
