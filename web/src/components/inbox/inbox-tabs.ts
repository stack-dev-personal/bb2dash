/**
 * R3-3: the Inbox's three filter tabs, as pure rules over the rows.

 * * Needs you: open rows, the questions nobody has answered.
 * * Answered, not applied: resolved or dismissed rows `/inbox-apply` has not
 *   archived yet. This is `v_inbox_queue` (090), so its count is the number
 *   the footer's "N answered" and the Apply answers press work through. A row
 *   the transform already stamped `applied_at` stays here until the worker
 *   archives it, and its chip says "applied".
 * * Archived: finished work, kept because the decision line lives on it.
