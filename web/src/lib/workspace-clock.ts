/**
 * bb2dash — the Workspace page's own clock (Phase 21, the review round of
 * 2026-10-06; ruling V4, findings CR-8 and CR-9).
 *
 * The page must not set the browser's wall clock beside the database's: a
 * laptop whose clock is minutes out would call a running service offline, or a
 * stopped one running. So every "how long ago" the Workspace decides by is
 * counted on one clock, this page's monotonic one (`performance.now()`), from a
 * moment this page saw itself. A changed system clock does not move it.
 *
 *   * `useMonotonicNow`  that clock for a render. A render may not read a clock,
 *                        so it is an external store, as `use-now.ts` is for the
 *                        wall clock.
 *   * `stampRead`        the moment this page read a row. The database says how
 *                        old the heartbeat was at that moment
 *                        (`polled_age_seconds`); the time since is this page's.
 *   * `monotonicNowMs`   the bare reading, for code that is not a render: the
 *                        60 s of the poll after a close (`workspace-poll.ts`).
 *
 * NOTHING HERE IS KEPT IN THE QUERY CACHE. That cache is saved to localStorage,
 * and a monotonic reading means nothing to the next page load. So a stamp is
 * held beside the row, by the row's identity: a row restored from the saved
 * cache is another object, has no stamp, and reads as "not read by this page".
