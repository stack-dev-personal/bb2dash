/**
 * bb2dash — the Workspace's live stream (Phase 21, task 4; P-87).
 *
 * An answer arrives twice: live, as Realtime Broadcast events on the private
 * topic `workspace:<conversation uuid>`, and once more as the stored row that
 * `workspace_finish()` writes. The stored row is the record; this hook is only
 * the live half, and losing any part of it costs live text, never the answer.
 *
 * THE WIRE (brief 102, "Realtime"; brief 111 adds `sources`). Three events, which
 * the page only receives:
 *   `delta`    `{request_id, seq, delta}`   `seq` starts at 1 and rises by 1 per flush
 *   `done`     `{request_id, message_id, state}`
 *   `sources`  `{request_id, state, found_n}`   the runner searched; sent once, before any text
 * `realtime.send` adds an `id` key to every payload. The named keys are read
 * and every other key is ignored.
 *
 * THE RULE ON THE PAGE.
 *   * Deltas render only as a contiguous run from seq 1.
 *   * If the lowest seq received is not 1 (a reload, a page opened mid-answer,
 *     a cold Realtime start) no partial text renders: `late` is true and the
 *     screen shows the one late-stream line until the stored row replaces it.
 *   * A gap holds later text back until the missing seq arrives. Text past a
 *     gap is never shown, `done` or not.
 *   * A repeated seq is dropped. Another request's deltas are never rendered.
 *   * `done` invalidates the conversation's messages (and its requests).
 *   * `sources` is kept on the view, and it and `done` invalidate the turns and
 *     the request's sources (`invalidateWorkspaceProvenance`).
 *   * STOP. Once the page marks a request stopped (`markStopped`), a later
 *     `delta`, `sources` or `done` for it changes nothing; what came before
 *     stays. An event name the hook does not subscribe to is never dispatched.
 *
 * ONE CHANNEL. To keep Realtime warm the page always holds exactly one private
 * channel: the conversation's when `?c=` is a uuid, else `workspace:lobby`. The
 * old channel is left before the next one is joined.
 *
 * NO STATE IS SET IN AN EFFECT BODY. Every event carries the topic it arrived
 * on, and the view is derived against the topic the page is on now, so moving
 * to another conversation shows nothing of the last one without a reset effect.
