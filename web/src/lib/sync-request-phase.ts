/**
 * bb2dash — the Sync button's read of an open request after the Phase 14 cut-over
 * (R-96's "the SyncButton's copy after cut-over", 2026-10-05).
 *
 * Since 2026-10-04 the desktop runs `syncLauncher = queue-only`: a press files the
 * `agent_requests` row and the `sync` container's runner claims it (`claimed_by =
 * 'sync-runner'`) within one poll of 25 s plus a login check. The app cannot see
 * the container; it sees only what the runner writes. So the phase is read off two
 * rows: the request, and the `sync_runs` row its claim opened (migration 135's
 * trigger), which the runner's fold moves from `running` to `ok`, `partial` or
 * `failed` before the files step and the close.
 *
 *   queued, never claimed, young  → waiting for the runner
 *   queued, never claimed, old    → unclaimed: nothing took it, the paste command is the fallback
 *   queued, claimed before        → requeued: the runner let it go (a restart); its next pass takes
 *                                   it — unclaimed too once it has waited ten minutes
 *   claimed by sync-runner        → starting (no run row) / crawling (running) / pulling files
 *                                   (folded) / finishing (the run failed; the close is next)
 *   claimed by anyone else        → a Claude Code session (the Windows /bb-sync skill)
 *   done / failed / cancelled
 *
 * Pure: nothing here imports React, TanStack Query or Supabase, and nothing throws.
 * Every "ago" comes in from the caller (`relativeTime`), as `sync-run-state.ts`
 * does, so one rule formats every relative time in the app. `queries.sync.ts` is
 * past the project's size rule, which is why this is its own file.
