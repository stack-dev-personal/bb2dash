/**
 * What the acceptance run's browser tests share (acceptance/README.md at the
 * root of the repository). A phase's tests are in `accept<NN>.spec.ts`; they
 * run under `accept.config.ts`, one at a time, started by the Claude operator
 * inside a throwaway sandbox container:
 *
 *   ACCEPT_ONLY="<title>" npx playwright test -c e2e/accept.config.ts
 *
 * Here, in this order: the recorder (window-sized shots and one facts file per
 * step); how a test is declared (the switch and the exact-title rule); the
 * hooks every file registers; what an earlier step left behind; reading a turn;
 * a question asked and recorded; the conversation list's rows; and the one
 * table write, Archive. `workspace-acceptance-helpers.spec.ts` drives the
 * parts that read the page against a still copy of it.
 *
 * THE SWITCH. Without `ACCEPT=1` every test is skipped where it is declared:
 * no hook runs, no page is opened, nothing is written. With it, a test runs
 * only when `ACCEPT_ONLY` is its exact title, so one call runs one test and a
 * pattern can never start several (the walk of 2026-10-07 did that once).
 *
 * WHAT A TEST LEAVES in `ACCEPT_OUT`, a folder outside every repository:
 * `<step>-<label>.png` for each shot it declares, each the size of the window,
 * never the whole page; `<step>.json`, its facts: state, badge, "Used:" line,
 * request and conversation ids, times, and the answer's text;
 * `<step>-fail.png` when it failed. The answer's text is never printed: it
 * quotes course material, and it stays in that folder.
 *
 * THE PAGE IS DRIVEN AS THE OWNER DRIVES IT. Asking and Stop are RPC calls and
 * pass the walk's write guard; every table write is aborted and fails the
 * test, but for Archive in the one test that asks for it (`allowArchive`).
 * Sign-out is aborted too: it would sign out every session of the owner.
 *
 * It reuses the walk's helpers (`walk.ts`, `walk21.lib.ts`,
 * `walk21.window.ts`) and, like them, imports nothing from `src/`.
