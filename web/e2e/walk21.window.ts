/**
 * The retake sitting's rule, as helpers (Phase 21's walk, 2026-10-07, after W-66
 * fixed the walk's W-1 and W-2): A SHOT IS THE WINDOW, 1440 by 900, never the
 * whole page and never a window made tall. A full-page shot of a tall window is
 * what hid W-2 in the first sitting.
 *
 * Here: the document against its window (W-1), the window shot and its read
 * back, what stands at the column's end (W-2), and the first sitting's archived
 * conversation opened by its row. `walk21.retake.spec.ts` uses all of it;
 * `06 stopped`, `07 offline` and `08 desktop` in `walk21.spec.ts` shoot under
 * the same rule.
 *
 * Not a spec: the config's `testMatch` takes `*.spec.ts` only.
