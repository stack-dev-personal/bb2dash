/**
 * Phase 23's acceptance tests: the Inbox's Apply answers button and the sync, on the live site (brief
 * 110, "The acceptance pack for Phase 23"; the pack is `acceptance/23/` at the root).
 *
 * THESE RUN ONLY INSIDE AN ACCEPTANCE RUN. Without `ACCEPT=1` every test here is skipped where it is
 * declared; with it, the one test whose exact title is `ACCEPT_ONLY` runs. The Claude operator in the
 * sandbox starts them one at a time, in the order they stand here, and reads what each leaves in
 * `ACCEPT_OUT` (`accept.lib.ts` says what that is).
 *
 * A title starts with the step of the acceptance script it is. Three stages run them, with the host's
 * own steps in between (`acceptance/23/manifest.json`):
 *
 * * `walk`: `1 raise questions`, `2 press sync`, `3 watch apply`, `4 archived`, `6 note and apply`.
 * * `offline`, run right after the host stopped the apply service: `7a offline press`.
 * * `back`, run after the host started it again: `7b taken after`.
 *
 * THE RUN'S OWN QUESTIONS. The run cannot answer Stack's Inbox questions for him, so step 1 raises four
 * of its own with the database function `inbox_accept_question(p_run, p_label)`, called through the
 * owner's signed-in session: the request headers the page itself sends are reused for one RPC call,
 * and are never written anywhere. Their labels are `confirm`, `dismiss`, `note` and `offline`; their
 * text is the function's own fixed sentence, so a card is found by that sentence and by the run tag
 * its source line shows (`accept/<tag>/<label>`). No course text is typed, read or written here.
 *
 * WHAT A TEST MAY WRITE. The shared hooks abort every table write. Each test below lets through only
 * the writes it is for, by table, method and (for a question) the item's id: the Inbox's Save and
 * Dismiss (a PATCH of `attention_items`), and the Sync and Apply answers buttons (a POST of
 * `agent_requests` of the kind that button files). Anything else still reaches the guard and fails.
 *
 * TIME. The shared limit of `acceptStep()` is 9.75 minutes a test, and a test may set its own inside
 * its body (`test.setTimeout`): steps 3, 6 and 7a do. Step 3 watches for nine minutes, step 6 for
 * eight and a half (the operator's own limit on one command is ten), and step 7a waits out the button's 75 second
 * grace and presses a second time.
 *
 * Everything is found by role and visible text, and nothing by a class name: another phase restyles
 * the Inbox.
