/**
 * S-1 / P-grades-7 — one status vocabulary, and no way back to two.
 *
 * The bug was not that any single screen was wrong; it was that four of them
 * each knew their own answer. `queries.today.ts` declared a nine-option menu
 * and a label map saying "not started" / "missed" / "n/a"; the Classwork row
 * spelled labels by replacing underscores; the popout read the query layer's
 * map; and `progress-status.ts`, the PM-owned file every screen was supposed to
 * read, was imported by nothing at all.
 *
 * Fixing the four call sites does not stop a fifth appearing, so this scans
 * `src/` for the two shapes that would start the drift again: a hard-coded list
 * of enum values outside the one file that owns them, and a second label map.
 * Same approach as test/audits.test.ts.
