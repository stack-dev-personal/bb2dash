/**
 * What the Workspace screen reads again, and when (Phase 21, wave 2b; the PM's
 * ruling U1 of 2026-10-06).
 *
 * THE STATUS, AT ONCE, WHEN THE SERVICE IS SEEN ANSWERING. The offline line is
 * said from a status row that is re-read every 30 s. A service that has just
 * come back claims a waiting question and streams its answer inside those
 * 30 s, so "The Workspace service is offline." could sit beside text that is
 * arriving. The status is therefore re-read at the two moments the page learns
 * the service is answering: a request in view becomes `claimed`, and its first
 * delta arrives.
 *
 * THE MESSAGES, EVERY 5 S FOR UP TO 60 S AFTER A REQUEST CLOSES WITH ITS ANSWER
 * UNSTORED (the review round's ruling V4, CR-9, which replaces U1's two timers
 * at about 3 s and about 10 s). The runner sees the cancel within seconds and
 * stores what it had written. That row reaches the page at its `done`
 * broadcast; if the broadcast is missed, the poll brings it. The poll is
 * decided from the rows (the newest request closed, its assistant row
 * unfinished), not from what the page held when Stop was pressed, and it ends
 * by itself: when the stored row lands, or 60 s after the page first saw the
 * request so. A stopped request with no assistant row has no runner and no
 * partial answer, so nothing is polled for it.
 *
 * Every case runs on a fake clock with the tab in front, so the only reads are
 * the ones the page asks for: nothing here waits on a real timer.
