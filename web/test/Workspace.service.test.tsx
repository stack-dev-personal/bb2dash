/**
 * The service line on a laptop whose clock is wrong (Phase 21, the review round
 * of 2026-10-06; ruling V4, finding CR-8).
 *
 * The page used to set the browser's clock beside the database's `polled_at`.
 * With migration 143 the status row carries `polled_age_seconds`, the heartbeat's
 * age as the database counts it, and the page adds only the time its own
 * monotonic clock has counted since it read the row.
 *
 * Each case mounts the screen over the fake client with the browser's wall
 * clock set apart from the database's, which is how the fault showed. The fake
 * timers move the monotonic clock with the timers; `vi.setSystemTime()` moves
 * the wall clock alone.
 *
 * The cases for a row without the column (143 not applied) are the standing
 * ones in `Workspace.test.tsx`, "the service line": none of their rows carries
 * the column, and they pass unchanged.
