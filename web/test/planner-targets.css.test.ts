/**
 * Phase 22, task 36 (D-5, row 31, entry `pointer-targets`; default 5 of amendment 3): the planner's
 * done box and event title get larger hit areas from a `::after`, and no box moves.
 *
 * A block is 24px for a half hour. The done box is 12px inside 3px and 5px of padding, and a tick
 * WRITES to the planner, so its larger area may never lie over the title:
 *
 *   - the done box's area is the `::after` of the label that wraps it (`display: contents`, so the
 *     box stays a flex child of the head row). The label is static, so the block, which is
 *     `position: absolute` and clips to its own edge, is the box the area is placed in; the box
 *     itself sits inside `.blockBody`, which clips and would cut an area drawn from the box;
 *   - the area starts at the block's top-left corner and ends at the box's own right edge, which is
 *     the edge on the title's side in a compact block (one row, the title to the right);
 *   - in a compact block it is the block's full height; in a taller block the title is on the row
 *     below, so it stops at the box's own bottom edge and never lies over the title;
 *   - the title's area is the rest of the block: its `::after` fills the block, the title stays
 *     static, and the box sits above it (`z-index`), so the box's centre is the box and the title's
 *     first pixel is the title;
 *   - `.block` keeps its `overflow`, `padding` and `line-height` (A3: `planner-rows.ts` mirrors them).
 *
 * jsdom lays nothing out, so the rules are read from the source. The measured proof is the walk
 * box's `planner targets` case of `theme-walk.spec.ts` (W-67): it presses the title's first pixel
 * and never the done box.
