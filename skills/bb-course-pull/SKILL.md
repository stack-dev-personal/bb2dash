description: 'Execute a course map. Refreshes file URLs, batch-downloads every file in a Blackboard Ultra course in one call, stores bytes in Supabase Storage plus a local mirror laid out class, bucket, assignment folder, files, extracts text and updates the typed tables. Use when Stack says pull a course or harvest a course, after bb-course-map.'

# bb-course-pull

Executes `course_maps` (latest version) for one course. Idempotent: re-running only touches rows
whose bytes changed. Never runs without a map; if none exists, invoke bb-course-map first.

## Preconditions
1. Latest map: `select map from course_maps where course_id=$1 order by version desc limit 1`.
2. Stack has approved this batch in chat (file count, course, largest size). One approval per run.
3. A browser is logged into Blackboard: built-in browser (`Claude_Browser__*`) preferred; Claude in
   Chrome as fallback. Check with a page-context probe (`location.href` not on the login page).
4. Downloads folder and the course-context folder are connected on the device.

## Step 0 — Refresh the manifest against Blackboard (mandatory; catalogs go stale within a day)
For every owning content item in the manifest, re-fetch `/learn/api/v1/courses/<bb_id>/contents/<content_id>`
from the logged-in tab and run `bb.refreshEmbeds(bb_id, ids)` / `bb.embedsDeep(item)` (from
`ingest/bb_crawler.js`). It scans EVERY string field of the item for `<a data-bbfile="{json}">`, not
just `body.rawText`: assessment and assignment items keep their attachments under
`contentDetail.<asmt>.test.assessment.instructions`, which a body-only scan misses entirely (IST 471
had 0 embeds catalogued that way; IST 323 hid two example decks the same way).
URL rule: keep only durable `bbcswebdav/pid-…-rid-N_1/xid-N_1` URLs (`resourceUrl`, else `viewerUrl`
minus its query string). A `/sessions/<id>/...` URL is session-scoped and returns 403 the next day; never
store one in `bb_files.source_url`. The same attachment usually appears twice (durable + session-scoped);
collapse by file name and keep the durable one.
Diff against the manifest: replace changed URLs (instructors re-upload; the old rid 404s), add files the
catalog lacks, and insert/patch `bb_files` before downloading. Lessons: the pilot had 1 stale URL of 6
and 1 missing file; the 9/8 validation found 3 files that only the deep scan sees.

## Step 1 — Fetch the bytes (no browser downloads)
- Build the manifest from the refreshed catalog, exactly as `ingest/pull_files.mjs`' header describes.
- **The browser downloads nothing.** In the logged-in tab, walk each `source_url`
  (+ `?xythos-download=true`) to its signed CDN URL with `resolveSignedUrl` from
  `ingest/fetch_signed.mjs`, one hop at a time (`maxRedirects: 0`), and write the resulting `hops`
  onto the manifest row. Then `node ingest/pull_files.mjs --manifest <json> --downloads <dir> --fetch`
  does the rest: download, magic-byte check, mirror, Storage, text, and the embed step.
- A chain that ends anywhere but `.content.blackboardcdn.com`, or runs past three hops, is refused
  and reported — never followed.
- 401/403 on the first hop means the Blackboard session died: stop the run and say so. A 404 means
  the file is gone; leave the row and mark it `superseded_by` its replacement.
- The crawler's anchor-click batch download and Playwright's `download` event are **not** used any
  more: the download event crashed the MCP browser on 2026-09-23, and the `<uuid>.tmp` files the
  batch route left behind had to be claimed by size and magic bytes, which mis-filed near-identical
  decks. The fetch path has neither problem.
- Progress: after every step post a one-line status to Stack (files landed / stored / extracted / DB
  updated) so a long run never looks stalled.
- Files only: never click test, survey, discussion, or attempt controls.
- Per file: sha256, bytes, mime. If a `bb_files` row with the same sha already has `storage_path`,
  mark duplicate and skip upload/extraction.

## Step 2 — Classify
- Start from the map's bucket for the file. If the map says `unclassified` or confidence < 0.8,
  open the extracted text (Step 4) and decide; write a one-line rationale to `bb_files.notes`.
- Never change a row where `classified_by = 'stack'`.

## Step 3 — Store (the end product: class → bucket → assignment folder → files)
- Link every file to its assignment first (`bb_files.assignment_id`; readings/slides get `week_no`).
  The canonical relative path is `bb_file_relpath(id)` (migration 008):
  `<course>/<bucket>/<assignment-slug>/<file>` when linked to an assignment,
  `<course>/<bucket>/week-NN/<file>` for lecture_slides/readings with a week, else `<course>/<bucket>/<file>`.
  `v_file_layout` shows the target path per row and `needs_move` for drift.
- Local mirror: PowerShell `Move-Item` from Downloads to `course context/<relpath>` (create dirs;
  rename `(1)` collisions back). Move hand-placed copies into the layout too. The Linux device shell
  cannot delete from mounted folders, so use PowerShell for moves.
- Canonical: `device_stage_files` the mirrored files, then `POST /storage/v1/object/bb-files/<relpath>`
  with the publishable key, correct Content-Type, NO `x-upsert` header (anon is insert-only; a changed
  file gets a new key; old keys need an authenticated Storage delete). Never use the service key in a browser.
- Update `bb_files` via the Supabase MCP: `storage_path='bb-files/'||bb_file_relpath(id)`,
  `local_path='course context/'||bb_file_relpath(id)`, sha256, bytes, mime_type, downloaded_at, bucket,
  week_no, links, classified_by, classification_confidence, text_status.
- Acceptance: `select count(*) from v_file_layout where course_id=$1 and needs_move` = 0 and the
  local tree matches (`Get-ChildItem -Recurse`).

## Step 4 — Extract text
- Stage files to the cloud workspace; run `ingest/extract_text.py` (pdftotext per page, python-docx
  whole doc, python-pptx per slide incl. notes, openpyxl per sheet). Store the units through
  `sync_file_text_put` (migration 200) as `sync_runner`: `ingest/pull_files.mjs` does it with the
  sync container's login (`ingest/text_put.mjs`). Since 201 there is no REST insert into `bb_file_text`.
  Set `text_status = extracted | failed | na` (na for images/media).

## Step 5 — Apply what the documents say
- If the pulled set includes a syllabus or schedule: run the bb-course-map "frame the course" step
  again against the new text and update `grading_schemes`, `grade_components`, `assignments`,
  `sessions`, `readings` (respecting the seed's confirmed/tentative rules). Bump the map version.

## Step 6 — Report
- `insert into sync_runs (source, scope, summary)` with counts: downloaded, duplicates, uploaded,
  extracted, failed, reclassified, gaps closed.
- Tell Stack: per-bucket counts (`v_course_corpus`), anything that failed, and any
  `stack_must_confirm` fields still open.

## Failure handling
- Download lands nowhere (viewer opened instead): retry with `?xythos-download=true`; if it still
  renders, screenshot and ask Stack once; do not loop.
- A 403/redirect to login: the session expired; stop, ask Stack to log in, resume from the manifest
  (rows without `downloaded_at`).
