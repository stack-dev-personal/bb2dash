# Phase 23: the apply container's entrypoint. Phase 21's (docker/workspace/entrypoint.sh), for the
# apply worker. It starts as root and, in this order:
#
#   1. raises the firewall (init-firewall.sh, default-deny egress). If it cannot be raised,
#      nothing else runs: the container stops, and its restart policy tries again;
#   2. makes /run/apply (0700, owned by node): the worker writes its MCP config and its
#      heartbeat file there, and the healthcheck reads the heartbeat;
#   3. drops to the `node` user with every capability gone, then runs the command (the worker).
#
# So no Node or `claude` process ever runs as root, and the NET_ADMIN and NET_RAW capabilities
# compose.yaml adds exist only for step 1. No secret is read here: the firewall reads the database
# host from its file, the worker and the two MCP servers read their own.
# Exit 78 (EX_CONFIG) on a refusal.
